"Here’s what happened in crypto today"

Cointelegraph 13 hours ago Here’s what happened in crypto today Need to know what happened in crypto
today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi,
NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Today in
crypto: The US Senate confirmed pro-crypto leaders for the CFTC and FDIC, Bitcoin advocates warned
that a US proposed de minimis tax relief may apply only to stablecoins transactions and spot Bitcoin
ETFs posted their biggest inflows in over a month, Senate confirms Selig for CFTC, Hill for FDIC The
US Senate has confirmed crypto-friendly lawyer Mike Selig as the new chair of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and has elevated Travis Hill to chair the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC)
in a 53-43 vote on Thursday. The pair were confirmed in a package of nearly 100 other nominees that
the Trump administration had picked for various roles across the government. The CFTC could soon
receive more crypto authority with bills working their way through Congress, and the FDIC is poised
to regulate some stablecoin issuers. Crypto executives, including Coinbase policy head Faryar
Shirzad, welcomed Mike Selig’s confirmation. Source: Faryar Shirzad Selig’s term will expire in
April 2029 once sworn in. He pledged to make crypto a priority when he was nominated in October
after he was picked to take over from the previous nominee, Brian Quintenz. Hill has already been
running the FDIC as the acting chairman and has also shared a friendly crypto stance, speaking at
Congressional hearings about the alleged debanking of companies due to crypto ties. Bitcoin Policy
Institute sounds alarm on de minimis tax exclusion Representatives of the Bitcoin Policy Institute
(BPI), a nonprofit Bitcoin advocacy organization, warned that US lawmakers have not included a de
minimis tax exemption for Bitcoin transactions below a certain threshold. “De Minimis tax
legislation may be limited to only stablecoins, leaving everyday Bitcoin transactions without an
exemption,” Conner Brown, BPI’s head of strategy, said on X, adding that the decision to exclude
Bitcoin is a “severe mistake.” In July, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced a bill proposing a
de minimis tax exemption for crypto transactions of $300 or less, with a $5,000 annual limit on tax-
free transactions and sales. The bill proposal also included tax exemptions for digital assets used
for charitable donations and tax deferment for crypto earned through mining proof-of-work (PoW)
protocols or staking to secure blockchain networks . Allowing a tax exemption for small Bitcoin
transactions would increase its use as a medium of exchange rather than just as a store of value
asset, allowing a new financial system built on a Bitcoin standard, BTC advocates say. Spot Bitcoin
ETFs record $457 million inflows in “early positioning” push Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $457 million
in net inflows on Wednesday , marking their strongest single-day intake in more than a month as
institutional demand showed signs of re-acceleration. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led
the inflows, recording the largest daily intake at roughly $391 million, accounting for the majority
of the day’s net inflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) followed with around $111
million, according to data from Farside Investors. Last time spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of over
$450 million was on Nov. 11. Source: Farside Investors The inflows lifted cumulative net inflows for
US spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs to more than $57 billion, while total net assets climbed above $112
billion, equivalent to around 6.5% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. The rebound followed a
choppy stretch in November and early December, when flows alternated between modest inflows and
sharp outflows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs last saw inflows above $450 million on Nov. 11, when funds pulled
in roughly $524 million in a single day. # Taxes # Business # Senate # CFTC # Regulation # ETF Add

Article Sponsored Sponsored Back Trusted Guest Post Businesses Eightcap Insights: Why Institutions
Are Buying Bitcoin’s Fear Written by Eightcap Edited by Dmitriy Maiorov 19 December 2025 09:55 UTC
Trusted The final quarter of 2025 has been a crucible for digital assets. Following the largest
single-day liquidation event in history, the cryptocurrency market finds itself in a state of
profound psychological flux. Beneath the surface noise of price crashes and sharp volatility, a
significant, and perhaps defining, structural divergence has emerged: retail sentiment is paralyzed
by fear, while institutional capital is quietly, but aggressively, accumulating. This divergence
suggests that the market is not heading for a sustained “crypto winter,” but rather a maturation
phase where long-term conviction is being forged at crucial price points. The Psychology of Fear vs.
The Logic of Allocation The prevailing market sentiment, as measured by the Fear & Greed Index, sits
firmly at 22 , signaling a deep state of Extreme Fear . Retail investors, having witnessed the sharp
plunge from October highs, are awaiting a clear directional signal before committing capital. Yet,
institutional behavior tells a different story entirely. Despite the market carnage, digital asset
investment products recorded a third consecutive week of net inflows, totaling $864 million . This
capital is not tentative, it is targeted. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) attracted the
overwhelming majority of these flows, with a significant rotation noted in 2025: while Bitcoin
inflows lag 2024’s pace, Ethereum’s YTD inflows are up an astonishing 148% , and Solana’s are up
tenfold . Institutions are not just returning to BTC, they are strategically diversifying their
exposure to the utility and staking yields offered by next-generation smart contract platforms. The
clearest signal of this unwavering conviction came this week from Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy)
. The firm executed a colossal $980 million Bitcoin purchase at an average price of $92,098. This
action, funded partly by equity sales, is an unequivocal public statement: corporate treasuries view
this current market downturn as a generational buying opportunity. It starkly highlights the Great
Divide : while emotionally driven retail investors panic-sold, sophisticated corporate players
doubled down, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role as an essential, long-term diversified treasury asset.
Macroeconomic Tailwinds and the Price Lag The technical recovery remains fragile, but the
macroeconomic backdrop is decidedly supportive. The Federal Reserve’s recent third 25 basis point
rate cut confirms an easing bias, moving the policy rate to 3.50%-3.75% . This move, while priced in
by the market and resulting in a muted immediate price response, is directionally supportive for
risk assets . Lower real rates and improving liquidity conditions traditionally reduce pressure on
speculative markets and create a favorable environment for assets that are sensitive to capital
flows, like crypto. The full transmission of this easing is a matter of when , not if . However, the
charts confirm that the internal market pressure is currently outweighing the external macro
tailwinds. Bitcoin (BTC): Trading near $87,492 , BTC is battling to establish a secure base, having
broken down multiple historical supports. The immediate support is anchored near $84,000 . The
market’s stability hinges on reclaiming the $90,000 threshold. Failure to do so risks a deeper
capitulation toward the $70,000 floor. Ethereum (ETH): Having sustained significant damage, ETH is
struggling near $2,959 , well below the crucial $4,000 level. The key structural support is at
$2,600 . While a decisive hold here could form a recovery base for an eventual run to the ATH, a
break below $2,600 would signal further deep weakness. Total Market Cap: The market capitalization
has contracted significantly to $2.94 trillion . Critically, this figure is now below a major
support level. A failure to reclaim the $3.0 trillion mark risks validating a broader breakdown and
exposing the next psychological floor near $2.6 trillion . Conclusion: Maturity Forged in Volatility
The current market dynamic is a reflection of a maturing asset class. The recent volatility has
served as a necessary leverage purge , flushing out weak hands and excessive risk. The ongoing
institutional accumulation, coupled with a supportive dovish shift from the Fed and structural
regulatory clarity (including the UK’s comprehensive rules and the U.S. advancements in stablecoin
frameworks), provides a strong demand-side anchor. The critical phase now is consolidation . The
market must stabilize and reclaim key levels, especially BTC above $94,000 and the total market cap
above $3.0 trillion . The institutional money is betting on this recovery. For those with a long-
term horizon, the current Extreme Fear index reading, combined with aggressive corporate buying, may
prove to be the most compelling buy signal of the cycle. You might also like Newsletter Subscribe

How ViaBTC Is Redefining the Miner Experience Written by Advertorial Edited by Dmitriy Maiorov 19
December 2025 07:49 UTC Trusted For much of Bitcoin’s history, mining pools served a single, narrow
purpose: aggregating hashpower and distributing block rewards. Miners were expected to manage
everything else on their own—wallets, exchanges, liquidity, risk management, and operational
financing—often across fragmented platforms with inconsistent security standards. That model is
rapidly becoming obsolete. As mining margins tighten, competition intensifies, and institutional-
grade professionalism becomes the norm, miners increasingly demand integrated ecosystems rather than
isolated services. In response, forward-thinking mining pools are evolving into comprehensive
financial hubs— one-stop shops that streamline operations while expanding growth opportunities. At
the forefront of this evolution is ViaBTC , whose diversified business model demonstrates how mining
pools can become strategic partners rather than simple service providers. Sponsored Sponsored Beyond
Hashrate: The Rise of Integrated Mining Ecosystems Modern miners face a complex operational
landscape. Profitability is no longer determined solely by hardware efficiency and electricity
costs. Instead, success depends on liquidity management, capital access, asset security, and the
ability to respond quickly to market conditions. This reality has driven a shift toward vertically
integrated mining platforms —ecosystems that allow miners to operate, manage, and grow their
holdings without constantly juggling assets between third-party services. ViaBTC has embraced this
shift by building a tightly integrated suite of tools that addresses the full lifecycle of a miner’s
activity—from block rewards to balance sheet management. Built-In Wallets: Security and Simplicity
by Design At the foundation of ViaBTC’s ecosystem is its secure, built-in wallet infrastructure ,
allowing miners to receive, store, and manage mining rewards directly within the platform. This
integration offers several critical advantages: Reduced counterparty risk by minimizing external
transfers Faster access to funds , without reliance on third-party wallets Unified account
management , simplifying bookkeeping and oversight For both individual miners and large-scale
operations, consolidating assets under a single, security-focused platform reduces operational
friction while improving transparency. Sponsored Sponsored Automatic Coin Conversion: Flexibility
Without Complexity Mining rewards do not always align with a miner’s preferred asset exposure.
Whether managing volatility, covering operating expenses, or reallocating into long-term holdings,
conversion flexibility is essential. ViaBTC’s automatic coin conversion functionality enables miners
to seamlessly convert rewards into alternative cryptocurrencies without manual intervention. This
allows miners to: Hedge against short-term volatility Align payouts with operational or treasury
needs Reduce time spent managing trades across multiple platforms By embedding this capability
directly into the mining workflow, ViaBTC removes unnecessary steps while empowering miners with
greater financial control. Collateral-Pledged Loans: Unlocking Capital Without Selling Coins One of
the most powerful features of ViaBTC’s diversified model is its collateral-pledged loan program —a
solution that directly addresses a long-standing miner dilemma: accessing liquidity without
sacrificing long-term upside. Sponsored Sponsored Instead of selling mined assets during unfavorable
market conditions, miners can use their cryptocurrency holdings as collateral to secure loans. This
enables them to: Fund hardware upgrades or facility expansion Cover electricity and operational
expenses Navigate temporary market downturns without forced liquidation By preserving asset exposure
while unlocking capital, collateral-backed lending transforms mining rewards into productive
financial instruments rather than static balances. Exchange Access via CoinEx: From Mining to
Markets Through its partnership with CoinEx , ViaBTC extends its ecosystem beyond mining into full
market participation. This integration gives miners direct access to a robust cryptocurrency
exchange, enabling: Efficient trading and liquidity access Portfolio diversification from a familiar
interface Reduced reliance on external exchanges and asset transfers The result is a seamless
transition from block rewards to broader market strategies—without leaving the ViaBTC ecosystem.
Sponsored Sponsored Convenience, Security, & Growth—Unified What distinguishes ViaBTC’s approach is
not merely the presence of individual features, but the cohesive integration of those features into
a single platform. Each component—wallets, conversions, loans, and exchange access—reinforces the
others. This unified design delivers three core benefits: Convenience – Fewer platforms, fewer
logins, fewer points of failure Security – Reduced asset movement and consolidated safeguards Growth
– Tools that enable strategic expansion, not just daily payouts In an industry where operational
efficiency can determine survival, these advantages are increasingly decisive. The Future of Mining
Pools Is Financial Infrastructure As cryptocurrency mining continues to mature, the role of mining
pools will continue to expand. The most successful platforms will not be those offering the lowest
fees alone, but those providing holistic financial infrastructure tailored to miners’ real-world
needs. ViaBTC’s evolution into a one-stop mining ecosystem reflects this future—one where miners are
empowered not only to earn, but to manage, leverage, and grow their digital assets with confidence.
For miners navigating an increasingly complex landscape, that transformation may be the most
valuable reward of all. You might also like Sponsored Businesses 20 hours ago XRP Asset Efficiency

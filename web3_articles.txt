"Here’s what happened in crypto today"

Cointelegraph 12 hours ago Here’s what happened in crypto today Need to know what happened in crypto
today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi,
NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Today in
crypto: The US Senate confirmed pro-crypto leaders for the CFTC and FDIC, Bitcoin advocates warned
that a US proposed de minimis tax relief may apply only to stablecoins transactions and spot Bitcoin
ETFs posted their biggest inflows in over a month, Senate confirms Selig for CFTC, Hill for FDIC The
US Senate has confirmed crypto-friendly lawyer Mike Selig as the new chair of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and has elevated Travis Hill to chair the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC)
in a 53-43 vote on Thursday. The pair were confirmed in a package of nearly 100 other nominees that
the Trump administration had picked for various roles across the government. The CFTC could soon
receive more crypto authority with bills working their way through Congress, and the FDIC is poised
to regulate some stablecoin issuers. Crypto executives, including Coinbase policy head Faryar
Shirzad, welcomed Mike Selig’s confirmation. Source: Faryar Shirzad Selig’s term will expire in
April 2029 once sworn in. He pledged to make crypto a priority when he was nominated in October
after he was picked to take over from the previous nominee, Brian Quintenz. Hill has already been
running the FDIC as the acting chairman and has also shared a friendly crypto stance, speaking at
Congressional hearings about the alleged debanking of companies due to crypto ties. Bitcoin Policy
Institute sounds alarm on de minimis tax exclusion Representatives of the Bitcoin Policy Institute
(BPI), a nonprofit Bitcoin advocacy organization, warned that US lawmakers have not included a de
minimis tax exemption for Bitcoin transactions below a certain threshold. “De Minimis tax
legislation may be limited to only stablecoins, leaving everyday Bitcoin transactions without an
exemption,” Conner Brown, BPI’s head of strategy, said on X, adding that the decision to exclude
Bitcoin is a “severe mistake.” In July, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced a bill proposing a
de minimis tax exemption for crypto transactions of $300 or less, with a $5,000 annual limit on tax-
free transactions and sales. The bill proposal also included tax exemptions for digital assets used
for charitable donations and tax deferment for crypto earned through mining proof-of-work (PoW)
protocols or staking to secure blockchain networks . Allowing a tax exemption for small Bitcoin
transactions would increase its use as a medium of exchange rather than just as a store of value
asset, allowing a new financial system built on a Bitcoin standard, BTC advocates say. Spot Bitcoin
ETFs record $457 million inflows in “early positioning” push Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $457 million
in net inflows on Wednesday , marking their strongest single-day intake in more than a month as
institutional demand showed signs of re-acceleration. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led
the inflows, recording the largest daily intake at roughly $391 million, accounting for the majority
of the day’s net inflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) followed with around $111
million, according to data from Farside Investors. Last time spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of over
$450 million was on Nov. 11. Source: Farside Investors The inflows lifted cumulative net inflows for
US spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs to more than $57 billion, while total net assets climbed above $112
billion, equivalent to around 6.5% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. The rebound followed a
choppy stretch in November and early December, when flows alternated between modest inflows and
sharp outflows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs last saw inflows above $450 million on Nov. 11, when funds pulled
in roughly $524 million in a single day. # Taxes # Business # Senate # CFTC # Regulation # ETF Add

How ViaBTC Is Redefining the Miner Experience Written by Advertorial Edited by Dmitriy Maiorov 19
December 2025 07:49 UTC Trusted For much of Bitcoin’s history, mining pools served a single, narrow
purpose: aggregating hashpower and distributing block rewards. Miners were expected to manage
everything else on their own—wallets, exchanges, liquidity, risk management, and operational
financing—often across fragmented platforms with inconsistent security standards. That model is
rapidly becoming obsolete. As mining margins tighten, competition intensifies, and institutional-
grade professionalism becomes the norm, miners increasingly demand integrated ecosystems rather than
isolated services. In response, forward-thinking mining pools are evolving into comprehensive
financial hubs— one-stop shops that streamline operations while expanding growth opportunities. At
the forefront of this evolution is ViaBTC , whose diversified business model demonstrates how mining
pools can become strategic partners rather than simple service providers. Sponsored Sponsored Beyond
Hashrate: The Rise of Integrated Mining Ecosystems Modern miners face a complex operational
landscape. Profitability is no longer determined solely by hardware efficiency and electricity
costs. Instead, success depends on liquidity management, capital access, asset security, and the
ability to respond quickly to market conditions. This reality has driven a shift toward vertically
integrated mining platforms —ecosystems that allow miners to operate, manage, and grow their
holdings without constantly juggling assets between third-party services. ViaBTC has embraced this
shift by building a tightly integrated suite of tools that addresses the full lifecycle of a miner’s
activity—from block rewards to balance sheet management. Built-In Wallets: Security and Simplicity
by Design At the foundation of ViaBTC’s ecosystem is its secure, built-in wallet infrastructure ,
allowing miners to receive, store, and manage mining rewards directly within the platform. This
integration offers several critical advantages: Reduced counterparty risk by minimizing external
transfers Faster access to funds , without reliance on third-party wallets Unified account
management , simplifying bookkeeping and oversight For both individual miners and large-scale
operations, consolidating assets under a single, security-focused platform reduces operational
friction while improving transparency. Sponsored Sponsored Automatic Coin Conversion: Flexibility
Without Complexity Mining rewards do not always align with a miner’s preferred asset exposure.
Whether managing volatility, covering operating expenses, or reallocating into long-term holdings,
conversion flexibility is essential. ViaBTC’s automatic coin conversion functionality enables miners
to seamlessly convert rewards into alternative cryptocurrencies without manual intervention. This
allows miners to: Hedge against short-term volatility Align payouts with operational or treasury
needs Reduce time spent managing trades across multiple platforms By embedding this capability
directly into the mining workflow, ViaBTC removes unnecessary steps while empowering miners with
greater financial control. Collateral-Pledged Loans: Unlocking Capital Without Selling Coins One of
the most powerful features of ViaBTC’s diversified model is its collateral-pledged loan program —a
solution that directly addresses a long-standing miner dilemma: accessing liquidity without
sacrificing long-term upside. Sponsored Sponsored Instead of selling mined assets during unfavorable
market conditions, miners can use their cryptocurrency holdings as collateral to secure loans. This
enables them to: Fund hardware upgrades or facility expansion Cover electricity and operational
expenses Navigate temporary market downturns without forced liquidation By preserving asset exposure
while unlocking capital, collateral-backed lending transforms mining rewards into productive
financial instruments rather than static balances. Exchange Access via CoinEx: From Mining to
Markets Through its partnership with CoinEx , ViaBTC extends its ecosystem beyond mining into full
market participation. This integration gives miners direct access to a robust cryptocurrency
exchange, enabling: Efficient trading and liquidity access Portfolio diversification from a familiar
interface Reduced reliance on external exchanges and asset transfers The result is a seamless
transition from block rewards to broader market strategies—without leaving the ViaBTC ecosystem.
Sponsored Sponsored Convenience, Security, & Growth—Unified What distinguishes ViaBTC’s approach is
not merely the presence of individual features, but the cohesive integration of those features into
a single platform. Each component—wallets, conversions, loans, and exchange access—reinforces the
others. This unified design delivers three core benefits: Convenience – Fewer platforms, fewer
logins, fewer points of failure Security – Reduced asset movement and consolidated safeguards Growth
– Tools that enable strategic expansion, not just daily payouts In an industry where operational
efficiency can determine survival, these advantages are increasingly decisive. The Future of Mining
Pools Is Financial Infrastructure As cryptocurrency mining continues to mature, the role of mining
pools will continue to expand. The most successful platforms will not be those offering the lowest
fees alone, but those providing holistic financial infrastructure tailored to miners’ real-world
needs. ViaBTC’s evolution into a one-stop mining ecosystem reflects this future—one where miners are
empowered not only to earn, but to manage, leverage, and grow their digital assets with confidence.
For miners navigating an increasingly complex landscape, that transformation may be the most
valuable reward of all. You might also like Sponsored Businesses 19 hours ago XRP Asset Efficiency

Markets $3.16 Billion Crypto Options Expiry Puts Bitcoin and Ethereum’s Next Move in Question
Written & Edited by Lockridge Okoth 19 December 2025 05:31 UTC Trusted $3.16 billion in Bitcoin and
Ethereum options expire, heightening volatility ahead of thin holiday liquidity. Bitcoin clusters
near $88,000 max pain, signaling range-bound action unless a breakout emerges. Ethereum positioning
is wider, keeping larger moves possible if volatility reaccelerates. Promo # News About Ethereum
(ETH) # News about Bitcoin (BTC) # Cryptocurrency Market News # Bitcoin (BTC) Analysis Over $3.16
billion worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum options are set to expire on Friday at 08:00 UTC on Deribit,
marking the final major derivatives settlement before Christmas. With liquidity thinning out as the
holiday period approaches and positioning tightly clustered around key price levels, traders appear
cautious, waiting for a clearer catalyst before committing to a direction. Sponsored What to Expect
as Nearly $3 Billion Bitcoin Options Expire Bitcoin accounts for the bulk of the expiry, with
roughly $2.69 billion in notional value rolling off. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at
$87,194 , representing a 0.54% increase over the past 24 hours. The max pain level for today’s
expiring Bitcoin options sits at $88,000, placing the spot price just below the strike. This is
where the greatest number of options expire worthless. Meanwhile, open interest data suggests a
relatively balanced but slightly defensive stance. Bitcoin call open interest stands at 17,506
contracts, compared with 13,309 puts, resulting in a total open interest of 30,815 contracts and a
put-to-call ratio of 0.76. Expiring Bitcoin Options. Source: Deribit While calls still dominate
numerically, the concentration of positioning near $88,000 points to limited upside momentum unless
the spot decisively breaks higher. Deribit analysts highlighted this dynamic in a market update.
“BTC open interest is concentrated around 88K, with slightly heavier put positioning, pointing to a
relatively contained expiry unless spot breaks range,” they wrote . Sponsored The commentary
reinforces the view that Bitcoin could remain range-bound through settlement, especially amid pre-
holiday caution . Over $470 Million Ethereum Options Expire Today: What Investors Should Know
Ethereum presents a different setup. Approximately $473 million in ETH options are expiring, with
the asset trading at $2,928, representing a 3.37% increase in the last 24 hours . ETH’s max pain
level is higher, at $3,100, leaving spot price meaningfully below the key strike. Ethereum’s open
interest profile is more evenly split, with 78,524 call contracts versus 83,547 puts. This results
in a put-to-call ratio of 1.06 and a total open interest of 162,071 contracts. Sponsored Expiring
Ethereum Options. Source: Deribit Unlike Bitcoin, ETH positioning is spread across a wider range of
strikes, indicating greater uncertainty about the near-term direction. “ETH positioning is more
distributed across strikes, with notable upside interest above 3.4K, keeping larger moves in play if
volatility reaccelerates,” Deribit analysts indicated. The analysts added that positioning suggests
patience into settlement, which happens at 08:00 UTC today, with traders waiting for a clearer
catalyst rather than forcing direction . Beyond today’s options expiry, attention is already
shifting to December 26 and early 2026 positioning. Sponsored “December 26 85k Put OI now ~15k
($1.25bn notional) on Deribit, and bears+FUD currently in control with ATM 86k,” Deribit Insights
noted . At the same time, upside bets appear less aggressive in the near term, with analysts
observing that “the Dec26 100k+ $1.75bn Call condor feels a distant punt now.” However, longer-dated
flows tell a more constructive story, with recent flows continuing to show upside bias into 2026.
According to the analysts, this suggests that while short-term sentiment remains cautious, longer-
horizon traders are still positioning for a renewed bullish phase. As the final options expiry
before Christmas approaches , both Bitcoin and Ethereum appear caught between near-term restraint
and longer-term optimism, leaving their next decisive move unresolved. Traders and investors may
experience some volatility, which the BOJ’s interest rate decision could exacerbate. However,
markets tend to stabilize as traders adjust to new market conditions. You might also like News

"Did Bitcoin's 4-year cycle break, and is the bull market really over?"
Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:55:34 +0000


Yashu Gola 8 minutes ago Did Bitcoin's 4-year cycle break, and is the bull market really over?
Bitcoin ETFs, corporate treasuries, and macro tailwinds are challenging BTC’s traditional four-year
cycle, which could result in new all-time highs in 2026. Listen 0:00 Market Analysis COINTELEGRAPH
IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Key takeaways : ETFs, treasuries, and macro tailwinds may snap Bitcoin’s four-
year boom-and-bust pattern. A bearish phase should not be ruled out before new all-time highs.
Bitcoin ( BTC ) has historically moved in four-year cycles tied to its halving events, with prices
typically peaking 12-18 months after each supply cut before sliding into a prolonged bear market.
This time was no different. Bitcoin peaked near $126,200 in October, exactly eighteen months after
the April 2024 halving, before declining by more than 30%. BTC/USDT weekly chart. Source:
TradingView The trend aligns with the early stages of past bearish phases, prompting veteran
analysts such as Peter Brandt to see Bitcoin falling toward $25,000 in the coming months. Bitcoin
traders are selling at losses João Wedson, founder of onchain analytics firm Alphractal, pointed to
the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) Trend Signal, a metric signaling the end of Bitcoin’s bull
market. Bitcoin’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) trend signal. Source: Alphractal Historically,
SOPR marked market turning points by tracking shifts between profit-taking and loss-driven selling.
In bull markets, SOPR stayed above 1 as coins were sold at a profit, often preceding local tops.
Near the bottom, it fell toward or below 1, signaling a realization of loss. A sustained recovery
above 1 later marked easing sell pressure and past rebounds. As of December, SOPR was trending
lower, showing BTC was being spent at smaller profits or at a loss. This supported the bearish
narrative based on the four-year cycle. “You may believe that Bitcoin’s cycles have changed and that
this time is different,” Wedson said, adding: “But, onchain analysis reveals that BTC continues to
follow its fractal cycle, just as it did before, nothing has changed so far.” New Bitcoin record
high coming by June 2026: Grayscale Multiple market observers noted that Bitcoin’s four-year cycle
may no longer be applicable, however. On Monday, US-based Grayscale Investments predicted that BTC’s
price would reach a new record high in the first half of 2026, citing a growing macro demand due to
currency debasement and a supportive regulatory environment in the US. “Fiat currencies (and assets
denominated in fiat currencies) face additional risks due to high and rising public sector debt and
its potential implications for inflation over time,” Grayscale wrote in its latest report , adding:
“Scarce commodities — whether physical gold and silver or digital Bitcoin and Ether — can
potentially serve as a ballast in portfolios for fiat currency risks.” US federal government debt as
a share of GDP. Source: Grayscale Bitcoin will enter a supercycle like commodities: Fidelity
Fidelity shared a similar bullish outlook in its 2026 crypto outlook report. The investment firm
discussed the odds of Bitcoin entering a “supercycle,” analogous to commodity supercycles in the
2000s that spanned nearly a decade. Related: Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is intact, but driven by
politics and liquidity: Analyst Central to this view is what Chris Kuiper, Fidelity Digital Assets’
vice president of research, called an “entirely new cohort and class of investors,” which could
support a longer market expansion than in past cycles. “We’ve seen traditional money managers and
investors begin to buy Bitcoin and other digital assets,” he said, adding: “I think we’ve only
scratched the surface in terms of the possible amount of money that they could bring into this
space.” As of December, US Bitcoin ETFs backed by BlackRock, Fidelity, and others collectively held
over 1.30 million BTC (~$114.13 billion), a 309% increase since their debut in January 2024. US

(~$100.42 billion) in their treasuries, an investor cohort that hardly existed before 2020. Bitcoin

demand from ETFs and corporate treasuries may be altering the boom-and-bust dynamics that have
historically defined Bitcoin’s four-year cycle. This article does not contain investment advice or

Cointelegraph 1 hour ago Here’s what happened in crypto today Need to know what happened in crypto
today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi,
NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Today in
crypto: HashKey debuted on Hong Kong’s HKEX exchange following a $206 million oversubscribed initial
public offering (IPO), Bhutan is putting 10,000 Bitcoin to use to develop its special administrative
region known as the Gelephu Mindfulness City, and the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC) proposed a framework under the GENIUS Act for banks seeking to issue payment stablecoins.
HashKey crypto exchange sees bumpy Hong Kong debut after $206 million IPO HashKey, Hong Kong’s
largest cryptocurrency exchange, made its trading debut on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HKEX)
following a $206 million initial public offering. Shares of HashKey Holdings officially listed on
the HKEX main board on Wednesday, opening at 6.70 Hong Kong dollars ($0.86), according to data from
the exchange. Announcing the news in a blog post, HashKey Group said the exchange became the first
publicly traded digital asset company in Asia to go public through an IPO in Hong Kong. “This
milestone marks the company’s entry into a new stage of development and establishes a stronger
foundation for its global expansion and long-term strategic initiatives,” the company stated.
Launched on Dec. 9 , HashKey’s IPO has received massive demand from institutional and retail
investors, selling a total of 240 million shares for $206 million, according to the company’s HKEX
filings. The Hong Kong offering was oversubscribed by nearly 394 times with 24 million shares sold,
while the international IPO reached 5.5 times the amount of stock on offer, selling 216.5 million
shares. Allotment results data in HashKey’s Hong Kong public offering. Source: HKEX The raise
attracted nine cornerstone investors, including Cithara Global Multi-Strategy SPC, UBS AM Singapore,
Fidelity and CDH. Cithara and UBS were the largest investors, allocated around 17.5 million shares
and 11.7 million shares, respectively. Bhutan pledges 10,000 Bitcoin to develop its “mindfulness
city” The Kingdom of Bhutan says it will tap into 10,000 Bitcoin from its stash to help build its
special administrative region, the Gelephu Mindfulness City (GMC). Located in the town of Gelephu in
Southern Bhutan, GMC was launched in 2024 as Bhutan’s new economic hub to stop the exodus of young
Bhutanese from the country by creating high-value local jobs. Concept photo of the Gelephu
Mindfulness City. Source: GMC The city offers regulatory flexibility for crypto and fintech firms
and serves as a space to further Bhutan’s Bitcoin mining. It covers roughly 10% of Bhutan, or around
1,544 square miles, according to its website. The plan to use Bitcoin for the Gelephu Mindfulness
City is part of the wider national Bitcoin Development Pledge, which aims to support Bhutan’s long-
term economic development through its Bitcoin stash and mining operations. US banks could soon issue
stablecoins under FDIC plan to implement GENIUS Act The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) is
moving forward with rule-making under the US GENIUS Act by proposing a framework for how regulated
banks could apply to issue payment stablecoins, a key early step in implementing the law’s
stablecoin provisions. In a 38-page document posted to the FDIC’s website, the agency detailed
proposed approval requirements for the issuance of payment stablecoins by subsidiaries of FDIC-
supervised institutions. As Bloomberg reported , the proposal is subject to a public consultation
period before advancing to the next stage of the rulemaking process. Under the proposal, banks would
apply to issue payment stablecoins through a subsidiary, with the FDIC assessing both the subsidiary
and its parent institution against criteria set out in the GENIUS Act . These include the ability to
meet stablecoin issuance standards, the institution’s financial condition, management quality,
redemption policies and other safety and soundness considerations. Once approved, the FDIC would
serve as the primary federal regulator overseeing the subsidiary’s payment stablecoin activities.
The FDIC is the US agency responsible for insuring bank deposits and supervising member
institutions. In recent years, it has taken a more active role in shaping how banks engage with
digital assets, including reconsidering the use of reputational risk in bank supervision. As
Cointelegraph reported in October , this shift could impact how financial institutions interact with
crypto-related businesses. Excerpts from the FDIC’s proposed framework for bank-issued payment

"Bitcoin price at ‘critical’ point as whale moves $348M BTC to exchanges"
Wed, 17 Dec 2025 12:08:40 +0000


Nancy Lubale 2 hours ago Bitcoin price at ‘critical’ point as whale moves $348M BTC to exchanges A
whale moved 4,000 Bitcoin to Binance, sparking fresh fears of a deeper BTC price drop if the $81,500
support level is lost. Listen 0:00 Market Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Bitcoin’s ( BTC
) market is at a “crucial moment” after breaking key long-term support levels, coinciding with large
BTC transfers from a digital asset treasury company to a major exchange. Key takeaways: Bitcoin
risks plunging into a bear market if it breaks below the True Market Mean at $81,500. Two wallets
linked to Matrixport transferred 4,000 Bitcoin to Binance, fueling fears of a fresh sell-off.
Bitcoin price must hold $81,500 Bitcoin has dropped toward and found support near its True Market
Mean (TMM), currently at $81,500, according to onchain data provider CryptoQuant. The True Market
Mean, or the Active-Investor Price, represents the cost basis of all non-dormant coins, excluding
miners. “This level has acted like a psychological line in the sand,” CryptoQuant analyst MorenoDV_
said in a Quicktake analysis on Wednesday. Related: Bitcoin institutional buys flip new supply for
the first time in 6 weeks When BTC trades above it, investors are generally comfortable, but when
this support is lost, the “same level often flips into resistance, as people who bought near the
average cost use rallies to exit,” the analyst said, adding: “Failure to hold the $81.5K level will
likely result in a sharp break below, followed by a search for support in the coming months.”
Bitcoin: True Market Mean. Source: CryptoQuant The chart above shows that the BTC/USD pair traded
above this level from Jan. 22 to May 5, 2022. When BTC dropped below this level on May 6, the price
lost a further 61%, bottoming at $15,500 in November of that year. The importance of this level is
reinforced by the AVIV Ratio — a metric that compares active market valuation with realized
valuation, focusing only on investor profits. The chart below shows that the AVIV Ratio is at levels
that have defined past mid-cycle transitions, a period where “the price tends to consolidate for a
while, to subsequently either form support or confirm a bear market ,” MorenoDV_ wrote, adding: “We
are at a critical moment.” Bitcoin: AVIV Ratio. Source: CryptoQuant. Trader and analyst Daan Crypto
Trades said the BTC/USD pair will continue “ranging with a choppy price action” until the major
support around the $84,000-$85,000 region is lost, or the “big resistance” at $94,000 is broken.

Bitcoin’s critical moment comes against the backdrop of renewed activity by whales who appear to be
doubling down on their capitulation. Lookonchain reported that two wallets, linked to financial
services giant Matrixport, moved a whopping 4,000 BTC, worth about $347.6 million, to the Binance
exchange . Source: Lookonchain Such large inflows often indicate the intention to sell or hedge
positions. Analyst 0xNobler said the company has “dumped 80% of its crypto holdings over the last 5
days,” adding: “They’ve been non-stop selling millions in BTC on Binance.” As Cointelegraph reported
, long-term holders and “OG” whales have been aggressively selling their Bitcoin holdings since mid-
October, threatening a prolonged BTC price correction to sub-$50,000 levels . This article does not

"Bitcoin institutional buys flip new supply for the first time in 6 weeks"
Wed, 17 Dec 2025 09:56:58 +0000


William Suberg 5 hours ago Bitcoin institutional buys flip new supply for the first time in 6 weeks
Bitcoin buying power from institutions flipped the daily mined BTC supply for the first time since
the start of November, new data showed. Listen 0:00 Markets News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED
Bitcoin ( BTC ) institutional demand is finally outpacing new supply as the market hits a key pivot
point. Key points: Bitcoin institutional demand is now 13% higher than the amount of newly mined BTC
on a rolling daily basis. New data shows institution-fueled supply reduction returning for the first
time since early November. ETF outflows pass $600 million in just two days this week. Institutions
bounce back with BTC buys New data from quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole
Investments shows that institutions are buying more BTC than miners are adding. Bitcoin is becoming
a target for institutions again as price action seeks a bottom more than 30% below October’s all-
time highs. Capriole reveals that for the past three days, institutional buying has surpassed the
newly mined supply. This is the first time that corporate demand alone has had a net reduction on
the BTC supply since the start of November. The figure remains modest compared to the peak of the
bull market two months ago. Currently, institutions are buying 13% more than the daily mined supply.

founder Charles Edwards earlier this month, the intervening period between the $126,000 highs and
recent lows of $80,500 has been marked by significant stress for market players, including
businesses opting to create Bitcoin corporate treasuries. In the last month there have been no new
treasury companies, but there have been first time treasury company sells pic.twitter.com/swXVJ9PvzS
— Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) December 5, 2025 Attention has focused on Strategy, the company with
the world’s largest such treasury, which has continued to add to its BTC holdings despite falling
prices and stock performance. Referencing its own AI-based analysis, Capriole’s Edwards this week
highlighted a “broken corporate ‘flywheel,' evidenced by record discounts to NAV among treasury
companies and rising leverage.” Despite Bitcoin looking attractive when judged by network
fundamentals, the pressure from corporate treasuries could be complicating the “path of least
resistance” for price recovery, the analysis added. Bitcoin ETF outflows meet “strategic
accumulation” Summarizing the status quo Wednesday, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant described
a “market in transition, where short-term pessimism contrasts with strategic accumulation.” Related:

Email ETFs bleed, keeping bitcoin in stasis: Crypto Daybook Americas Your day-ahead look for Dec.
17, 2025 By Omkar Godbole | Edited by Sheldon Reback Dec 17, 2025, 12:15 p.m. (Midjourney/Modified

ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC $ 87,018.43 has churned between $86,000 and $88,000 over
the past 24 hours, with Tuesday’s U.S. jobs data failing to inject meaningful volatility. The price
sits near a major technical level which, if broken, could bring more pain. STORY CONTINUES BELOW
Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today . See all

to our terms of use and privacy policy . The number of BTC/USD longs (bullish bets) on Bitfinex
continues to climb, reaching 72,184 at press time, the highest since February 2024. It may sound
counterintuitive, but rising longs have historically turned out to be contrarian indicators,
accompanying prolonged downtrends. Adding to the gloom, the 11 U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs bled
$227 million on Tuesday following Monday’s $357.69 million outflow. So, in two days, the ETFs have
lost over $584 million. That's more than double last week’s net inflow of $286.60 million, according
to SoSoValue. Clearly, institutional appetite for BTC has weakened, leaving the market in a fragile
state. The lack of a bullish response to Tuesday's spike in the U.S. jobless rate to its highest
level since April 2021, a figure that supports Fed rate-cut bets, also points to market exhaustion.
“For crypto, the lack of reaction is telling. Markets appear more focused on internal liquidity and
positioning than macro releases," said Timothy Misir, head of research at BRN. "Until macro data
meaningfully shifts rate expectations or liquidity conditions, price action is likely to remain
range-bound and reactive rather than directional.” Speaking of positioning, options market data
point to expectations for a broad range trade between $85,000 and $100,000 in the near term. In the
wider crypto market, there are some gainers like the Cardano-based NIGHT $ 0.06499 token, which has
gained 9% in 24 hours. SKY and XMR have added 4% each, while the rest of the top 100 tokens are in
the red. The CoinDesk 20 and CoinDesk 80 indices are both down over the period. Shares in crypto
exchange HashKey fell 5% early Wednesday following their debut in Hong Kong. In traditional markets,
the dollar index has recovered from 2.5-month lows to above 98.00, with the 10-year Treasury yield
holding steady above 4.10%. The Chinese yuan remains bid at two-month highs, offering policymakers
room to provide stimulus to the slowing economy. Stay alert! Read more: For analysis of today's

direction. By Oliver Knight , Omkar Godbole | Edited by Sheldon Reback Dec 17, 2025, 11:30 a.m.
Bitcoin drifted lower overnight (Midjourney/Modified by CoinDesk) What to know : BTC dropped 1.5%
from its overnight high, with failure to reclaim $94,700 last week reinforcing a downtrend marked by
lower highs since early October. The CoinDesk 20 has lost 1.6% since midnight UTC, while bitcoin
dominance rose, underscoring continued underperformance across altcoins. The average crypto RSI sits
at 38.49, suggesting the market is oversold and could be due a short-term relief rally despite the
absence of clear year-end catalysts. In this article LTC LTC $ 78.95 ◢ 2.27 % BTC BTC $ 87,018.43 ◢
1.14 % DOGE DOGE $ 0.1311 ◢ 2.01 % The crypto market slipped overnight, with bitcoin BTC $ 87,018.43
dropping 1.5% from the high it hit in the early hours of Wednesday. The broader market followed
suit. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) fell 1.6% since midnight UTC with all members of the index declining.

break above $94,700 last week has extended a downtrend that started in early October with a series
of lower highs. In order to break the bearish trend and stage a recovery, the largest cryptocurrency
needs to trade back above $95,000 and ideally $98,000, although year-end catalysts remain absent.
Much of the market is, however, in "oversold" territory according to the average crypto relative
strength index (RSI) , which is at 38.49/100, indicating the potential for a short-term relief
rally. Derivatives positioning BTC's 30-day implied volatility, represented by Volmex's BVIV,
remains below an annualized 50%, suggesting market calm ahead of Thursday's U.S. inflation data and
Friday's Bank of Japan rate decision. BTC's 90-day historical volatility is now consistent with
major tech stocks such as Tesla and Nvidia, a sign of market maturation. BTC/USD longs on Bitfinex
have hit highest since February. Open interest (OI) in futures tied to most tokens, including BTC
and ether ETH $ 2,949.89 , has declined over 24 hours. BCH, UNI and NEAR stand out with moderate
increases in OI. On Deribit, put writing at bitcoin's $85,000 strike and call writing at $95,000 and
$100,000 strikes point to expectations for a broad range play in the near term. Block flows featured
straddles and risk reversals in BTC and call calendar spreads in ether. Broadly speaking, both BTC
and ETH puts remain pricier than calls, pointing to persistent downside concerns and call
overwriting. Token talk The altcoin market continues to exhibit weakness against bitcoin trading
pairs with bitcoin dominance rising to 58.7% from 57.8% on Nov. 26. ASTER and TAO are the two worst-
performing altcoins out of the top 100, posting a 6.5% and a 6.1% move to the downside since
midnight UTC. The plunge in ASTER extends a bearish trend since the weekly candle open on Monday,
with a slide in excess of 20% as the hype around BNB Chain derivatives exchanges continues to wane.
There were a handful of bullish outliers in the altcoin market, these included monero XMR $ 428.85 ,
up by 0.2% since midnight and Cardano's privacy token, NIGHT, which rose by more than 5% mid-morning
in Europe. The "altcoin season" indicator is at 19/100 as the market firmly remains focused on
bitcoin since October's liquidation wipeout. Crypto Markets Today Derivatives Markets market

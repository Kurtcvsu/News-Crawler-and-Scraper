Vince Quill 10 hours ago Senior Vanguard analyst says Bitcoin is no better than a plush toy The comments followed the asset management company’s policy change allowing its clients to trade crypto exchange-traded funds. Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Bitcoin is a purely speculative asset and is akin to a collectible toy, according to John Ameriks, the global head of quantitative equity at asset management company Vanguard. “It’s difficult for me to think about Bitcoin as anything more than a digital Labubu,” Ameriks said at Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth conference in New York City. Labulus are collectible plush toys featuring animals with anthropomorphic features. Despite Ameriks’ criticism, he said that Bitcoin ( BTC ) may have value beyond financial speculation in the future under certain circumstances. The cryptocurrency could find real-world use cases beyond market speculation in scenarios of high fiat currency inflation or political instability, Ameriks said.

Related: Bitcoin first, crypto at scale: Inside the UAE’s layered digital asset strategy Vanguard finally makes the crypto leap Vanguard was the last of the three major asset management companies, which include BlackRock and State Street, to allow clients to hold crypto investment vehicles. “We allow people to hold and buy these ETFs on our platform if they wish to do so, but they do so with discretion,” Ameriks said , adding that Vanguard won’t offer investors “advice as to whether to buy or sell or which crypto tokens they ought to hold.” ETFs remain a significant source of capital inflows into the digital asset markets. Source: Farside Investors The policy change gives Vanguard’s over 50 million clients exposure to crypto markets and creates yet another bridge between traditional finance and digital assets, funneling money into crypto networks. The fresh capital injections from Vanguard’s clients could boost prices for cryptocurrencies tied to exchange-traded funds.

Cointelegraph 10 hours ago Here’s what happened in crypto today Need to know what happened in crypto today? Here is the latest news on daily trends and events impacting Bitcoin price, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, Web3 and crypto regulation. Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Today in crypto: NYDIG says tokenization won’t hugely benefit crypto until assets are freed up, the OCC approved several crypto-related bank charter applications and Phantom Wallet partnered with Kalshi to bring prediction markets into its app. Tokenization benefits ‘light at first,’ but could improve: NYDIG The tokenization of stocks will be “light at first” and not immediately of great benefit to the crypto market , but that could change if the assets “interoperability and composability increase,” NYDIG global head of research Greg Cipolaro said on Friday. He said the initial benefits of tokenized assets will be the transaction fees charged for using them and the hosting blockchain would see “increasing network effects,” but more favorable regulations should result in an expanded reach and access “should become more democratized.” Cipolaro said that making interoperable tokenized assets isn’t straightforward, as they “differ greatly” and are hosted on public and non-public blockchains. Most also still need traditional financial structures to remain legal. Tokenizing assets such as US stocks has become popular this year with major exchanges wanting to launch tokenized stock platforms. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Paul Atkins has also said that the US financial system could embrace tokenization in a “couple of years.” Paxos, Ripple, Circle and others secure US trust bank approvals The US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has conditionally approved five national bank charter applications for companies tied to the digital assets industry. In a Friday notice, the OCC said it had conditionally approved BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets and Paxos to convert their existing state-level trust companies into federally chartered national trust banks. In the same announcement, the regulator said it had conditionally approved new applications from Circle and Ripple for national trust bank charters. “New entrants into the federal banking sector are good for consumers, the banking industry and the economy,” said Jonathan Gould, the Comptroller of the Currency, adding: “The OCC will continue to provide a path for both traditional and innovative approaches to financial services to ensure the federal banking system keeps pace with the evolution of finance and supports a modern economy.” The five crypto companies are just a few of the many in the industry seeking regulatory approval from the OCC to expand their presence in the banking sector. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase said in October it had filed an application but had “no intention of becoming a bank.” Although the wording of each applicant’s letter was slightly different, the companies said they would utilize the charters to provide digital asset custody services to clients. Though Paxos’ application permitted the bank to issue stablecoins, Ripple’s explicitly said its charter would “not be a stablecoin issuer” for its US dollar-pegged coin, RLUSD ( RLUSD ). “Paxos’ federally regulated platform will allow businesses to issue, custody, trade and settle digital assets with clarity and confidence,” said Paxos in a Friday statement.

The companies said on Friday that the integration would allow Phantom users to discover trending events, track live odds and place bets without leaving their wallets. A new feature called Phantom Prediction Markets will allow users to trade tokenized positions that reference Kalshi’s event markets across politics, economics, sports and culture. “By integrating a layer of tokenized positions referencing Kalshi’s regulated event markets with Phantom, users can trade what they care about in real time,” said Phantom CEO Brandon Millman.

Biraajmaan Tamuly 11 hours ago Short-term Bitcoin traders were profitable for 66% of 2025: Will profits rise in 2026? Short-term Bitcoin traders were profitable for 229 days this year despite the recent 30% correction in BTC price. Will this trend carry over into 2026? Listen 0:00 Market Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) short-term holders (STHs) have spent 229 out of 345 days in profit, an outcome that appears contradictory given that BTC is at a negative year-to-date (YTD) return and struggles to trade above $100,000. However, beneath the weak headline performance, the structure of onchain positioning tells a different story. Key takeaways: Bitcoin short-term holders logged profits for 66% of 2025, even while BTC traded below its yearly open. The STH realized price at $81,000 acted as a sentiment pivot, which divided phases of panic and recovery. Unrealized losses narrowed to -12% from -28%, signaling fading capitulation. Bitcoin trades near its realized price The volatility of 2025 can be explained through the lens of the one– to three-month STH cohort. As illustrated in the chart, Bitcoin’s price repeatedly interacted with its realized price, producing alternating waves of green net-unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) profitability and red NUPL losses. Bitcoin STH realized price and NUPL range. Source: CryptoQuant Early in 2025, BTC stayed above this cost basis for nearly two months, giving STHs their first pocket of sustained profits. But the shift into February and March saw prices fall below the cohort’s realized price, dragging STH NUPL into deep red and marking one of the year’s longest loss stretches. However, momentum reversed sharply from late April through mid-October, where the chart’s broad green zones align with Bitcoin’s 172-day period of predominantly profitable STH activity. Even though the broader trend was softening, these recoveries pushed STH profitability far higher than the market narrative implied. Only in late October did the market slip back beneath the realized price again, triggering the ongoing 45-day period of STH losses that coincides with the swelling red NUPL region. Bitcoin STH realized price against BTC. Source: CryptoQuant In effect, STH profitability in 2025 was driven less by Bitcoin’s directional trend and more by the frequency with which BTC reclaimed its cost basis. Those repeat rebounds, even within a negative YTD environment, allowed short-term holders to finish with a two-thirds profit ratio. Related: Bitcoin decouples from stocks in second half of 2025 The BTC cost basis shift may define the next phase again Bitcoin’s rebound toward $92,500 compressed STH unrealized losses to -12% from -28%, a sign that forced selling is easing and emotional exhaustion is setting in. The STH realized rice at $81,000 remains the psychological fulcrum, as each reclaim historically marks the transition from capitulation into stability. BTC age-band unrealized P&L distribution. Source: CryptoQuant New money and investors entering within days to weeks hover near breakeven, reinforcing this stabilizing structure. If BTC continued to improve STH profitability while holding above this $81,000 foundation, the late-year correction could already be nearing completion, setting the stage for the next expansion phase.

Rakesh Upadhyay 12 hours ago Price predictions 12/12: BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, SOL, DOGE, ADA, BCH, HYPE, LINK Bitcoin and several major altcoins have turned down from their respective overhead resistance levels, indicating that the bears are still very active at the range highs. Listen 0:00 Price Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Key points: The failure of the bulls to maintain Bitcoin above $94,050 has renewed selling, opening the doors for a fall to $87,700 and then to $84,000. Most major altcoins remain under pressure and are threatening to challenge their recent lows. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is stuck inside a narrow range between $94,588 and $89,260, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears. The prediction markets do not expect the bulls to take charge in the near term, giving only a 30% chance of BTC hitting $100,000 before Jan. 1. According to crypto analyst Darkfost, BTC is struggling to recover due to a lack of incoming liquidity, specifically from stablecoins. The crypto markets will have to attract new liquidity for BTC to start a “genuine bullish trend.” Crypto market data daily view. Source: TradingView Some analysts expect BTC to fall below the recent low of $80,600. Trader Roman said in a post on X that BTC is likely to drop to $76,000 , and that falling interest rates will not be able to prevent it. What are the crucial support and resistance levels to watch out for in BTC and major altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin price prediction BTC’s recovery is facing resistance at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $94,050, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView There is support at $87,700 and then at $84,000. A break below the $84,000 level opens the gates for a retest of the Nov. 21 low of $80,600. Buyers will need to push the Bitcoin price above the $94,050 resistance level to signal strength. The BTC/USDT pair may then climb to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA)($97,411). The up move is expected to face significant selling in the zone between the 50-day SMA and the psychological level of $100,000. A close above $100,000 indicates that the bulls are back in the game. Ether price prediction Ether ( ETH ) turned down from the $3,350 level on Thursday, and the bears are attempting to sustain the price below the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($3,125). ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If they succeed, it indicates that the bears remain sellers on rallies. The Ether price may drop to $2,907 and later to $2,716. The ETH/USDT pair could resume its downtrend on a close below $2,623. Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the $3,350 resistance, it signals the start of a new upward move. The pair may rise to $3,918 and then to $4,250. BNB price prediction BNB ( BNB ) has been trading near the 20-day EMA ($892) for the past few days, indicating equilibrium between buyers and sellers. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midFpoint suggest a range-bound action between $791 and $1,020 for the next few days. Sellers will have to sink the BNB price below the $791 level to start the next leg of the downtrend. The BNB/USDT pair may then collapse to $730. On the upside, a close above $1,020 indicates that the correction may be over. The pair could then rally to $1,182, which may act as a resistance. XRP price prediction XRP ( XRP ) remains stuck inside the descending channel pattern, indicating that the bears are in control. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will have to propel the XRP price above the 50-day SMA ($2.25) to indicate strength. The XRP/USDT pair may then rally to the downtrend line, which is a vital level to watch out for. A close above the downtrend line signals that the bulls are back in the driver’s seat. The bears will have to sink the price below the $1.98 level to clear the path for a drop to the support line and then to the critical level at $1.61. Solana price prediction The long tail on Solana’s ( SOL ) Thursday candlestick shows that the bulls are aggressively defending the $126 level. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will have to propel the Solana price above the 50-day SMA ($152) to signal a potential trend change in the near term. The SOL/USDT pair could then ascend to $172 and subsequently to $190. On the other hand, a break and close below the $126 level signals the resumption of the downward move. The pair may plummet to $100 and, after that, to the strong support at $95. Dogecoin price prediction Dogecoin ( DOGE ) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($0.14) on Wednesday, indicating that the bears are selling on every minor rally. DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price continues lower and closes below the $0.13 support, it signals the start of a new downward move. The DOGE/USDT pair could then plunge to the Oct. 10 low of $0.10, which is likely to attract buyers. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day EMA. That shows the bulls are fiercely defending the $0.14 level. The Dogecoin price may climb to the 50-day SMA ($0.16) and later to $0.19. Cardano price prediction Cardano ( ADA ) turned down from the breakdown level of $0.50 on Wednesday, indicating that the bears are trying to flip the level into resistance. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.44) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative territory indicate a slight edge to the bears. There is support at $0.40 and then at $0.37. If sellers pull the Cardano price below $0.37, the ADA/USDT pair could tumble to $0.31 and potentially to the Oct. 10 intraday low of $0.27. Buyers will have to push and maintain the price above the $0.50 level to signal a comeback. The pair could then rally to $0.60 and later to $0.70. Related: Ether price rallied 260% last time this happened: Can ETH reach $5K? Bitcoin Cash price prediction Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($560) on Thursday, indicating a positive sentiment. BCH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will strive to drive the Bitcoin Cash price above the $607 level and challenge the overhead resistance at $651. Sellers are expected to defend the $651 level with all their might, as a break above it opens the doors for a rally to $720. The bears will have to sink the price below the moving averages to gain the upper hand. If they manage to do that, it suggests that the BCH/USDT pair could range between $607 and $443 for some time. Hyperliquid price prediction Sellers attempted to pull Hyperliquid (HYPE) lower on Thursday, but the long tail on the candlestick shows buying by the bulls. HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The HYPE/USDT pair could reach the 20-day EMA ($31.91), which is a critical level to watch out for. If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the bears will again attempt to resume the downtrend. On the contrary, a break above the 20-day EMA signals that the selling pressure is reducing. The Hyperliquid price could then rise to the 50-day SMA ($37.23). A close above the 50-day SMA suggests the corrective phase may be over. Chainlink price prediction Chainlink ( LINK ) has been trading between the moving averages for the past few days, indicating a balance between supply and demand. LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The tight range trading is likely to be followed by a range expansion. If the price breaks and closes above the 50-day SMA ($14.71), it signals that the bulls have overpowered the bears. The LINK/USDT pair could then climb to $19.06. Alternatively, a sharp dip below the 20-day EMA ($13.84) indicates that the bears remain in control. The Chainlink price could then plummet to the solid support at $10.94, where the buyers are expected to step in. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Zoltan Vardai 13 hours ago Bitcoin swings above $94K as crypto faces ‘Netscape’ moment: Finance Redefined Bitcoin briefly topped $94,000 following Strategy’s largest investment since July, but investor risk appetite remained muted even after the widely expected US interest rate cut. Listen 0:00 Newsletter COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Cryptocurrency markets saw another week of downside, as investors eagerly anticipated the year’s last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose to a weekly high of $94,330 on Tuesday as investor morale was bolstered by Strategy’s $962 million Bitcoin acquisition, the company’s largest investment since July 2025. On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve delivered a widely anticipated 25-basis-point interest rate cut. Crypto markets saw a temporary bounce, as lower rates and cheaper borrowing costs typically increase risk appetite and capital entering risk assets such as crypto. However, the market’s upside was temporary, as the Fed’s latest interest rate cut was “widely expected and pretty much priced in,” CoinEx exchange’s chief analyst, Jeff Ko, told Cointelegraph. Despite the lack of investor appetite, fundamental developments such as the increasing number of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the improving usability of onchain products are ushering in a potential “Netscape” moment for the crypto industry, analysts told Cointelegraph. Historic sentiment and price patterns follow Fed rate cuts. Source: Santiment Crypto nears its “Netscape” moment as industry approaches inflection point The cryptocurrency industry is approaching its “Netscape” moment, as steady progress in blockchain infrastructure and the rise of regulated investment products drive a new wave of institutional adoption, according to Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang. The crypto sector is “facing its ‘Netscape’ or ‘iPhone’ moment,” Huang wrote Sunday in a post on X. “It’s working bigger than ever before, far beyond our wildest dreams. Both the institutional parts and the cypherpunk parts.” Netscape launched the first easy-to-use web browser for mainstream users in 1994 before going public with a successful initial public offering (IPO) in August 1995, marking the first building block that triggered the internet’s mass adoption. However, Microsoft saw the large-scale interest and capitalized on it on it by freely bundling Internet Explorer as a pre-installed component of the Windows operating system, outcompeting Netscape to become the most widely used internet browser.

About 30% of the Pepe ( PEPE ) token supply was bundled at launch in April 2023, blockchain data visualization platform Bubblemaps claimed on Wednesday in a post on X, adding that investors were “lied to.” The same wallet cluster sold $2 million worth of PEPE tokens the day after launch, adding significant sell pressure that stopped the token from surpassing the $12 billion milestone, according to Bubblemaps. That concentration of the genesis supply contrasts with Pepe’s original branding as a “coin for the people.” The project’s website said the token launched “in stealth” with no presale allocations.

Mullin also said OKX’s post referenced “arbitrary dates throughout December 2025,” while Mantra has not yet announced an official implementation date.

Sam Bourgi 15 hours ago Figure Technology files ‘second IPO’ to bring native equity issuance to Solana Figure is planning a second IPO to issue blockchain-native equity on Solana, enabling onchain trading and DeFi use cases beyond traditional stock markets. Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Figure Technology, a blockchain-based financial services company focused on tokenized assets and lending, has filed for a second public offering aimed at issuing native equity directly on a public blockchain. The move, which follows the company’s recent Nasdaq listing, is designed to expand decentralized finance (DeFi) use cases on Solana. Speaking at the Solana Breakpoint conference, Figure executive chairman Mike Cagney said the company has submitted a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch what he described as “a new version of Figure equity on a public blockchain,” specifically Solana. Cagney said the blockchain-native equity would not trade on traditional exchanges such as Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange, nor would it rely on introducing brokers like Robinhood or prime brokers such as Goldman Sachs. Source: Solana Instead, the security would be issued and traded natively onchain via Figure’s alternative trading system , which he characterized as “effectively a decentralized exchange.” By issuing equity directly on Solana, investors would be able to take the tokenized security into DeFi protocols , where it could be borrowed against or lent out, Cagney said. He added that the company’s broader goal extends beyond tokenizing its own shares, with plans to support native equity issuance for other companies directly within the Solana ecosystem: “One of the focus points that we have is not only bringing that equity over to the Solana ecosystem but allowing for native Solana equity issuance as well.” Related: Figure Technology boosts IPO size, total deal could reach $800M Tokenization on Solana is gaining momentum Already one of the largest public blockchains by activity, Solana is increasingly emerging as a hub for tokenized assets, with its share of the real-world asset (RWA) market expanding steadily over the past year. While Ethereum continues to dominate tokenization today, Solana is likely to become the financial industry’s preferred network for stablecoins and tokenized assets over time, according to Matt Hougan , chief investment officer at Bitwise. As Wall Street evaluates the long-term viability of tokenized assets, attention is expected to shift toward blockchains that offer high speed, throughput and fast transaction finality, areas where Solana holds a competitive advantage over many rival networks, Hougan said. Research from RedStone identified Solana as a “high-performance challenger” in the RWA space, particularly in tokenized US Treasury markets. Solana’s RWA metrics, excluding stablecoins.

By Helene Braun , James Van Straten , Krisztian Sandor | Edited by Oliver Knight Updated Dec 12, 2025, 4:04 p.m. Published Dec 12, 2025, 4:04 p.m. Bitcoin (BTC) price (CoinDesk) What to know : Bitcoin drops below $90,000 as ongoing AI related jitters weighed on U.S. stock market indices. Broadcom shares fell 10% on Friday after earnings outlook disappointed investors' high expectations. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who opposed a rate cut in December, said he is projecting more interest rate cuts in 2026 than the current median outlook. Artificial intelligence-focused stocks are coming under pressure on Friday, dragging tech-related equities and bitcoin BTC $ 90,378.26 lower during the early U.S. session. Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), the ninth largest asset by market cap, tumbled 10% despite strong earnings as its outlook disappointed investors' lofty expectations.

The Nasdaq index was down over 1% in the first hour of the session. Adding that to Oracle's 10% slump on Thursday and a further 3% decline on Friday, as investor concerns are mounting that the red-hot AI theme that fueled much of this year's stock market gains might be fizzling out. Bitcoin, trading around $92,500 overnight, plunged 2% following the U.S. stock market open to $89,800 recently, extending the choppy action through the week. A consistent theme this week has been bitcoin setting intraday lows during U.S. trading hours, a pattern that has led to the filing of the proposed AfterDark Hours ETF . Bitcoin miners, some of which have been increasingly leaning into AI for diversification, showed a similar reaction to Broadcom’s miss. Hut 8 (HUT) fell more than 5%. Iren (RIEN) and Riot (RIOT) dropped about 4%, while Cipher(CIFR) and Iren (IREN) both were down about 2% over the past day. Crypto-related stocks also fell alongside the Nasdaq. Robinhood (HOOD) and Strategy (MSTR) were both down nearly 2%. Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) was hit hard and fell more than 5%. Coinbase (COIN) dropped slightly. Markets had already been under pressure after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's speech on Wednesday, which hinted at a possible rate cut pause in January. As a result, markets now expect only two rate cuts in 2026 instead of three. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee , who was against a December rate cut, however, said he expects more in 2026 than the current median projection. Several other members of the Federal Reserve will also speak over the course of today as the central bank's blackout period following its December meeting on Wednesday has ended. Traders will be looking for any guidance on whether Fed officials agree with Powell on potentially holding rates steady in January.

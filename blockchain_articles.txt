"Most crypto sectors lagged Bitcoin over past 3 months: Glassnode"
Tue, 16 Dec 2025 06:10:26 +0000


Martin Young 6 hours ago Most crypto sectors lagged Bitcoin over past 3 months: Glassnode Bitcoin
fell 26% in three months but outperformed most crypto sectors as Ether dropped 36%, AI tokens fell
48%, and memecoins dipped 56%. Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Despite a decline
from all-time highs, Bitcoin has still performed better than most other cryptocurrency sectors in
recent months, indicating that capital and investment continue to favor Bitcoin, according to
Glassnode. Over the past three months, “the average return across nearly all crypto sectors has
underperformed Bitcoin,” reported onchain analytics platform Glassnode on Tuesday. “This persistent
relative weakness highlights a market environment where capital concentration favours BTC.” The
comments came in response to a post from institutional-grade reporting platform Bitcoin Vector
stating that the first half of the year was Bitcoin-dominated, but “the picture flipped” in the
second half. Bitcoin Vector explained that “dominance trended lower, making room for ETH rotation,
but never fully reclaiming leadership afterward.” They added that recent attempts to rebuild after
the deleverage event have weakened again by year-end, “signaling low conviction in BTC leadership
and a market still searching for a clear anchor.” Ether, AI, memes and RWA all fell harder
Glassnode’s latest post appears to disagree with this sentiment. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has retreated by
around 26% over the past three months, reaching current levels of around $86,000. This is slightly
better than the overall decline in total market capitalization of 27.5% over the same period,
according to CoinMarketCap. Most other crypto sectors have seen larger declines than Bitcoin.
Source: Glassnode Ether ( ETH ) has taken a significant hit since mid-September, falling
approximately 36% to its current levels below $3,000. The same theme is true for many other sectors
or token categories, such as AI, which has declined 48%, memecoin market cap, which has tanked 56%,
and the real-world asset tokenization category, which is down 46% over the three-month period,
according to CoinMarketCap. The DeFi token category is down 38% over the past three months,
according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin remains a safer haven in crypto Nick Ruck, director of LVRG
Research, agreed, telling Cointelegraph that the data over the past three months indicates that
capital inflows continue to favor Bitcoin, “reflecting a strong investor preference for BTC’s
stability.” Related: Bitcoin to hit new all-time high within 6 months: Grayscale “This capital
concentration underscores Bitcoin’s dominant position in the market, leaving altcoins struggling to
stay relevant amid the current environment,” he added. “This trend is likely driven by Bitcoin’s
established reputation and increasing institutional interest, which bolster its appeal as a safer
haven in the volatile crypto landscape.” Magazine: Do Kwon sentenced to 15 years, Bitcoin’s ‘choppy

Stephen Katte 6 hours ago Ripple pilots RLUSD on Ethereum L2s in multichain push Ripple is testing
RLUSD on layer 2s Optimism, Base, Ink, and Unichain, after the token initially launched on the XRP
Ledger and Ethereum in 2024. Listen 0:00 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Ripple Labs is
expanding its US dollar-backed stablecoin RLUSD to Ethereum layer-2 blockchains as part of a pilot
while it awaits regulatory approval for a full rollout next year. In partnership with Wormhole, a
crosschain interoperability protocol that allows assets to move between different blockchains , the
pilot will test RLUSD on Optimism, Base, Ink (an Ethereum layer 2 developed by Kraken), and
Unichain, according to a statement from Ripple on Monday. Initially, RLUSD was issued on the XRP
Ledger and Ethereum ; however, Ripple said that the latest expansion is “essential for a scalable,
efficient, and interoperable future.” “The future of crypto is undeniably multichain, and to truly
serve both institutional finance and the growing onchain economy, stablecoins must exist wherever
demand and utility are.” Source: Ripple “As chains continue to build for real-world use, the need
for a highly regulated stablecoin is stronger than ever,” the Ripple team added. RLUSD will avoid
using wrapped copy across blockchains The Wormhole team said in an X post on Monday that its Native
Token Transfers standard will allow RLUSD to move across blockchains as the real token, as opposed
to a synthetic or wrapped copy, which will help maintain liquidity. In some multichain setups , when
a token is transferred, it’s locked on its original blockchain while a wrapped copy version is
minted on another. Source: Wormhole “With NTT, token issuers eliminate the need for fragmented
liquidity or wrapped assets, allowing a single, canonical version of RLUSD to exist natively on each
blockchain with Ripple owning the contracts,” the Wormhole team added. More chains are coming next
year RLUSD will launch on subsequent chains next year, but the launch is still subject to final
regulatory approval, according to Ripple. RLUSD is issued under the state-level New York Department
of Financial Services Trust Company Charter, while the company has also applied for a federal trust
bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, to add Federal oversight. Jack
McDonald, senior vice president of stablecoins at Ripple, said stablecoins are the “gateway to DeFi
and institutional adoption.” “By launching RLUSD—the first US Trust Regulated stablecoin on these L2
networks—we are not just expanding utility; we are setting the definitive standard where compliance
and onchain efficiency converge.” RLUSD market capitalization sits at $1.3 billion RLUSD, launched
in December 2024, has a market capitalization of $1.3 billion, according to crypto data aggregator
CoinGecko. Related: Ripple’s RLUSD enters top 10 USD stablecoins less than year after debut In

supported assets from the Ethereum, Solana, Monad and Sei blockchains. “Any Bitcoin transactions you
make will appear in your asset list once confirmed. Remember: Bitcoin transactions are typically
slower than those on EVM or Solana networks,” MetaMask said. The move enables users to buy BTC, swap
to BTC, send and receive BTC, with users being incentivized to use the asset , with any swaps into
BTC earning people MetaMask reward points. Source: MetaMask Prior to this, MetaMask users could only
gain exposure to BTC via wrapped versions of the asset. The BTC integration was first discussed back
in February, with MetaMask’s Dan Finlay suggesting it would go live in the third quarter of 2025.

things off with the Solana integration in May and followed that up with Sei in August and Monad in
November. The firm has kept its cards close to its chest, but has indicated that more networks will
be added next year. “Bitcoin support marks the latest step in our multichain expansion, following
the launch of Monad and Sei earlier this year, with more networks to come in 2026,” MetaMask said.

"Crypto urges SEC to see the good in blockchain privacy tools"
Tue, 16 Dec 2025 04:10:13 +0000


Jesse Coghlan 8 hours ago Crypto urges SEC to see the good in blockchain privacy tools US Securities
and Exchange Commission chair Paul Atkins says the agency must find how to allow people to use
blockchain privacy tools “without immediately falling under suspicion.” Listen 0:00 News
COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Crypto industry executives have urged the US Securities and
Exchange Commission to shift its thinking on blockchain privacy tools, pitching that there are
legitimate applications for them outside of criminal use. The SEC hosted crypto and finance
executives for a discussion and panel on financial surveillance and privacy on Monday, the agency’s
sixth crypto-focused roundtable this year, as it seeks to overhaul its approach to crypto. StarkWare
general counsel Katherine Kirkpatrick Bos, who participated in a panel discussion, told
Cointelegraph after the event that a major takeaway was that there shouldn’t be an assumption that
those using and creating privacy tools are “overwhelmed by wrongdoers.” “Why is the assumption that
an individual needs to affirmatively prove that they are compliant or they’re using the tool for
good?” “As opposed to it being the other way around, where the assumption is that this individual is
using the tool for good until there is some sort of indication that they’re using it for bad,” she
said. Kirkpatrick Bos added that “of course, wrongdoers were using, or are using those tools, but
there needs to be a balance.” Katherine Kirkpatrick Bos (left) discussing financial privacy at an
SEC roundtable on Monday. Source: Paul Brigner During the roundtable, Wayne Chang, the founder and
CEO of the credential management company SpruceID, said some percentage of users of stablecoins , a
crypto tool that is slowly becoming mainstream, will want privacy. “There are a ton of stablecoins
that aren’t onchain yet that would come onchain if there is privacy,” he said. “We’re going to see
an increase in demand for privacy-preserving blockchains.” “My hope is that regulators continue to
engage industry, and we can have those discussions on how to keep privacy for folks while also
having tools that are useful,” Chang said. Customer checks are becoming outdated Kirkpatrick Bos
said a discussion on Know Your Customer ( KYC ) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures focused on
whether current rules are sufficient in the age of artificial intelligence . “The question arose and
was debated on the panel, well, what is necessary for Anti-Money Laundering?” she said. “Now we have
AI. It’s made manual, AML and KYC antiquated. How do we solve for that?” “There was a sense that the
current system of AML and KYC is antiquated, it’s problematic, it’s ineffective,” she added. “But
there needs to be some sort of check when it’s a centralized entity facilitating flows of money to
ensure that they’re not helping wrongdoers.” Many financial institutions request a picture of a
user’s driver’s license for its KYC checks, which Kirkpatrick Bos said was “absurd, because an
individual can go on the internet and develop a fake driver’s license in a matter of seconds.” “So
the question is, can cryptography-based tools improve that and make it harder for bad guys to do
that? But can they also do that and make it harder for bad guys while preserving an individual’s
privacy and not revealing data like an address, where it is not necessary to vet the legality of the
funds?” she added. Some projects have begun to test crypto-based solutions for proving identity
while claiming to preserve privacy , such as Sam Altman’s World, which gives users a cryptographic
key they can use to prove they’re human. SEC’s Atkins warns of potential for crypto mass
surveillance SEC chair Paul Atkins had given opening remarks at the roundtable, warning that if
“pushed in the wrong direction, crypto could become the most powerful financial surveillance
architecture ever invented.” “If the instinct of the government is to treat every wallet like a
broker, every piece of software as an exchange, every transaction as a reportable event, and every
protocol as a convenient surveillance node, then the government will transform this ecosystem into a
financial panopticon,” he added. Related: SEC ’eased up on’ 60% of crypto enforcement cases under
Trump: Report Atkins said that crypto allows for “privacy-preserving tools that the analog world
could not provide,” which some institutions depend on to build positions or test strategies without
“instantly telegraphing that activity to competitors.” He added that some of the technology could
balance the government’s interest in deterring security threats and the public’s privacy. “But to
best strike this balance, we must make certain that Americans can use these tools without
immediately falling under suspicion.” Magazine: 2026 is the year of pragmatic privacy in crypto —

tightening liquidity and broader macro uncertainty. Listen 0:00 Market Analysis COINTELEGRAPH IN
YOUR SOCIAL FEED Key takeaways: Leverage surged in the crypto market, with $527 million in
liquidations in 24 hours, signaling growing caution among traders. Tighter liquidity and increasing
AI debt risks push traders to exit riskier assets, contributing to a market correction. The
cryptocurrency market saw a correction on Monday, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) retesting the $85,000 level
and Ether ( ETH ) dropping to $2,900. Traders became more risk-averse after a survey showed
worsening economic conditions in the United States and changes in investor expectations regarding
the proposed options for the next US Federal Reserve chair. US five-year Treasury (left) vs. Total
crypto capitalization, USD. Source: TradingView The resilience of the US five-year Treasury after
hitting a low of 98.64 on Wednesday points to a more defensive shift in positioning as liquidity
conditions tightened across global markets. That caution comes amid mounting fiscal pressures after
a recent tax and spending package extended credits and raised the US debt ceiling by $5 trillion.
Also, the Federal Reserve said it will begin purchasing about $40 billion per month in short-dated
Treasury bills as part of a technical reserve-management operation aimed at maintaining ample
liquidity, a move policymakers have stressed is not a return to broad quantitative easing or a shift
in the Fed’s monetary policy stance. The consumer sector remains a concern, as a CNBC survey
revealed that 41% of Americans plan to spend less during the holidays this year, up from 35% in
2024. Additionally, 61% of respondents cited affordability problems due to stagnant wages amid
rising prices. US October retail sales data will be released on Tuesday, along with November nonfarm
payrolls figures. Total crypto market open interest, USD. Source: CoinGlass Excessive leverage in
the cryptocurrency market continues to be a major issue, with futures open interest standing at $135
billion. Over $527 million worth of bullish leveraged positions have been liquidated in the past 24
hours, causing traders to worry about further downside. Weakness in the artificial intelligence
sector has also driven traders to increase cash positions, exiting riskier asset classes like
cryptocurrencies. Hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates reportedly said that tech firms’ heavy
reliance on debt markets to fund AI investments has reached a dangerous phase, according to Reuters.
“Going forward, there is a reasonable probability that we will soon find ourselves in a bubble,"
Bridgewater's co-chief investment officer Greg Jensen wrote in a note. Annualized funding rate on
Monday. Source: CoinGlass Demand for leverage on short (sellers) positions surged on Bybit, pushing
the annualized funding rate below zero. This unusual situation, where longs (buyers) are paid to
keep their leveraged positions open, rarely lasts as arbitrage opportunities emerge. Still, since
the Oct. 10 crash, liquidity has become much tighter, with some market makers likely facing sizable
losses. Part of Monday’s decline in the US stock market can be attributed to a decrease in Kevin
Hassett’s odds of replacing Jerome Powell as the next Fed chair. CNBC reported that President Donald
Trump’s inner circle pushed for someone perceived as more independent. Trump said on Friday that
Kevin Warsh would also be a great fit, which eased concerns about the fragility of the US dollar.

Gromen turns bearish on Bitcoin Bitcoin and Ether are generally seen as part of an independent

According to Velo data , Monday is the third-worst performing weekday for bitcoin over the past 12
months, trailing only Thursday and Friday in terms of average returns. Throughout 2025, several of
bitcoin’s major local lows have occurred on Mondays, a pattern highlighted in the chart below.
BTCUSD (TradingView) A key level to monitor for potential bitcoin support is the U.S. ETF cost basis
. This metric represents the average entry price of bitcoin held by spot ETFs and is calculated by
combining daily ETF inflows with bitcoin’s price at the time of each deposit to form a running
average. See also: XRP ETFs pass $1 billion mark with no outflow days since launch The aggregate
cost basis for U.S. bitcoin ETFs currently sits near $83,000, according to Glassnode data, a level

Today: Bitcoin, ether extend pullback amid thin liquidity, macro jitters Bitcoin and ether extended
losses alongside weak equities, while oversold signals offered a tentative glimmer of hope for
battered altcoins. By Oliver Knight , Omkar Godbole | Edited by Sheldon Reback Dec 16, 2025, 11:30
a.m. Crypto market extends pullback amid macro weakness (Shutterstock modified by CoinDesk) What to
know : Bitcoin fell 4% to $86,100, ether slid 6.7% to below $3,000. Crypto is tracking equities
lower as concerns the AI bubble may collapse and weak U.S. jobs expectations hit the Nasdaq. Tokens
like XRP, SOL and ADA are nearing key support levels, raising the chances of a short-term bounce.
The crypto market failed to recover from Monday's sell-off, with bitcoin BTC $ 87,169.78 trading 4%
lower at $86,100 and ether dropping back below $3,000 after slumping 6.7% in 24 hours. The slide
sent the CoinDesk 20 Index down 4.3%, with all members of the index lower, alongside a move to the
downside in traditional markets. The Nasdaq Composite fell for a second straight day on Monday,
losing 2.6% in the period, on concerns over the potential of an AI bubble and weak employment data.
The U.S. is due to report labor market statistics including November's nonfarm payrolls number later
Tuesday. STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas

suggest around 50,000 new hires were made, less than half the 119,000 seen in September, but the
range of expectations is much wider than usual," Derren Nathan, head of equity research at
Hargreaves Lansdown, said in an email. "If recent private jobs data is anything to go by, the risk
here is to the downside." The crypto market has significantly underperformed equities since the
October wipeout, in part due to a lack of liquidity that means general price movements continue to
be exaggerated. Derivatives positioning Volmex's one-day BVIV, which measures an annualized expected
price turbulence over 24 hours, remains locked in recent ranges above 50%. This implies a 24-hour
move of 2.6%, which is nothing out of ordinary even as key economic data are due for release.
Exchanges liquidated over $660 million in leveraged futures bets in 24 hours. Most of these were
longs, clearing bullish leverage from the market. The cumulative global open interest (OI) in BTC
futures crossed above 700K BTC, the highest since Nov. 21. An uptick in OI alongside a drop in spot
price is said to represent an influx of bearish short positions and confirm downtrend. XRP's futures
OI rose to 1.96B XRP, the highest since Oct. 11. The OI-adjusted cumulative volume delta for most
major tokens fell, indicating aggressive net selling pressure. On Deribit, BTC and ETH put options
continue to trade pricier than calls, indicating persistent downside concerns. The persistent put
premium also stems from institutional interest in call overwriting strategies . The $85K bitcoin put
has emerged as the second-most popular option behind the $100K call. Block flows featured BTC put
diagonal spreads, put ration spreads and straddles. In ETH's case, traders preferred put
butterflies. Token talk The altcoin market continues to yearn for a bullish catalyst following a
two-month period of corrective price action. ASTER, ONDO and STRK all lost more than 10% in the past
24 hours, underperforming the wider market. One glimmer of hope for the altcoin market is that
several tokens are now in "oversold" territory, according the average crypto relative strength index
(RSI) indicator. This suggests that the market may be ready for a slight bounce before the U.S.
employment figures are released. A number of tokens including XRP, SOL and ADA are also approaching
key levels of support that provided a series of local bottoms over the past year, so while altcoin
sentiment is low, this could be an area that sparks investor appetite. Crypto Markets Today

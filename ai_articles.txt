App developers looking to launch their programs in ChatGPT can now submit them for review and
potential publication, OpenAI said Wednesday. The company also introduced a new app directory within
Chat’s tools menu that has swiftly been dubbed an “app store.” In October, the company announced the
arrival of apps in its chatbot, explaining that the move would bring a broader suite of capabilities
to ChatGPT users. Major platforms — including Expedia, Spotify, Zillow, and Canva — announced
integrations that would allow users to access their services directly from Chat conversations. Now,
the company is opening up the field to a broader array of players. “Apps extend ChatGPT
conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take actions like order groceries, turn
an outline into a slide deck, or search for an apartment,” the company said Wednesday. OpenAI’s Apps
SDK, which is still in beta, currently provides a toolkit for developers looking to create new
experiences for ChatGPT users. Once developers are ready, they can submit their apps to the
company’s OpenAI Developer platform , where they will be able to track its approval status, the
company said. A number of approved apps will start launching within Chat in the coming year, it
added. This is a big step for OpenAI toward expanding the app ecosystem within Chat and, at the same
time, giving users more reasons to use the app and stay on it. Topics AI , Apps , ChatGPT , In Brief

"ChatGPT’s mobile app hits new milestone of $3B in consumer spending"
Thu, 18 Dec 2025 19:50:02 +0000


ChatGPT has hit a new milestone of $3 billion in worldwide consumer spending on mobile as of this
week, according to estimates from app intelligence provider Appfigures . This figure represents the
total spending on iOS and Android devices since the app’s launch in May 2023, when it first arrived,
then only on iOS. Image Credits: Appfigures What’s notable is that the bulk of that spending took
place this year. Worldwide, consumers spent an estimated $2.48 billion in the ChatGPT mobile app in
2025, representing a 408% year-over-year increase from the $487 million spent in 2024. In 2023, the
app’s first year of availability, it earned $42.9 million, before growing 1,036% to reach the 2024
figure. Image Credits: Appfigures These numbers represent a sharp rise in consumer adoption,
compared with other popular apps. For instance, it took ChatGPT 31 months to reach $3 billion in
consumer spending, but the top earner, TikTok, took 58 months to do so, Appfigures told TechCrunch.
ChatGPT also reached the milestone faster than top streaming apps like Disney+ and HBO Max, which
hit the $3 billion figure in 42 months and 46 months, respectively. Image Credits: Appfigures xAI’s
Grok, however, is seeing a similar revenue trajectory to ChatGPT, compared with other AI rivals.
Grok was released in late 2023 to X Premium Plus subscribers before becoming more broadly available
last year. But if you compare the pace of consumer spending across AI apps, Grok came the closest to
matching ChatGPT’s cumulative revenue at the same point, once it began monetizing. (You can see this
on the chart below, which plots the AI apps’ spending aligned to when each app began monetizing.)
Image Credits: Appfigures While the $3 billion in spending represents a significant uptake by
consumers, it’s not the only way to measure AI app adoption or potential long-term revenue.
ChatGPT’s mobile customers are buying paid subscriptions, like the $20 per month ChatGPT Plus or the
$200 per month ChatGPT Pro for advanced users. But AI apps can generate revenue in other ways,
including through developer offerings and, perhaps soon for ChatGPT , ads. In addition, ChatGPT on
Wednesday launched its own app store of sorts, which the company suggests will be monetized in some
way in the future, its blog post noted . Google, meanwhile, is exploring the potential to transition
its healthy search ads business to AI-powered search, placing ads in AI Mode , AI Overviews , AI
shopping , and an increasingly AI-powered Discover page , among other things. Anthropic is aiming at
the business market and is reportedly on track for $70 billion in revenue by 2028. Topics AI , AI ,

Follow See All by Emma Roth is a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto,
social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. OpenAI and Anthropic
are rolling out new ways to detect underage users. As OpenAI has updated its guidelines on how
ChatGPT should interact with users between the ages of 13 and 17, Anthropic is working on a new way
to identify and boot users who are under 18. On Thursday, OpenAI announced that ChatGPT’s Model Spec
— the guidelines for how its chatbot should behave — will include four new principles for users
under 18. Now, it aims to have ChatGPT “put teen safety first, even when it may conflict with other
goals.” That means guiding teens toward safer options when other user interests, like “maximum
intellectual freedom,” conflict with safety concerns. It also says ChatGPT should “promote real-
world support,” including by encouraging offline relationships, while laying out how ChatGPT should
set clear expectations when interacting with younger users. The Model Spec says ChatGPT should
“treat teens like teens” by offering “warmth and respect” instead of providing condescending answers
or treating teens like adults. The change comes as lawmakers turn up the pressure on AI companies
and their chatbots over their potential impact on mental health. OpenAI is currently facing a
lawsuit alleging that ChatGPT provided instructions for self-harm and suicide to a teen who took his
own life. OpenAI later rolled out parental controls and said ChatGPT will no longer talk about
suicide with teens. It’s part of a larger push for online regulation that also includes mandatory
age verification for a number of services. OpenAI says the update to ChatGPT’s Model Spec should
result in “stronger guardrails, safer alternatives, and encouragement to seek trusted offline
support when conversations move into higher-risk territory.” The company adds that ChatGPT will urge
teens to contact emergency services or crisis resources if there are signs of “imminent risk.”
Related OpenAI denies liability in teen suicide lawsuit, cites ‘misuse’ of ChatGPT The nine people
trying to stop AI from ruining the world Along with this change, OpenAI says it’s in the “early
stages” of launching an age prediction model that will attempt to estimate someone’s age. If it
detects that someone may be under 18, OpenAI will automatically apply teen safeguards. It will also
give adults the chance to verify their age if they were falsely flagged by the system. Anthropic,
which doesn’t allow users under 18 to chat with Claude, is rolling out measures that it will use to
detect and disable the accounts of underage users. It’s developing a new system capable of detecting
“subtle conversational signs that a user might be underage,” and says it already flags users who
self-identify as a minor during chats. Anthropic also outlines how it trains Claude to respond to
prompts about suicide and self-harm, as well as its progress at reducing sycophancy, which can
reaffirm harmful thinking. The company says its latest models “are the least sycophantic of any to
date,” with Haiku 4.5 performing the best, as it corrected its sycophantic behavior 37 percent of
the time. “On face value, this evaluation shows there is significant room for improvement for all of
our models,” Anthropic says. “We think the results reflect a trade-off between model warmth or
friendliness on the one hand, and sycophancy on the other.” Update, December 18th: Clarified that
Anthropic doesn’t allow users under 18 to use Claude. Follow topics and authors from this story to

Gemini’s AI verification feature to videos made or edited with the company’s own AI models. Users
can now ask Gemini to determine if an uploaded video is AI-generated by asking, “Was this generated
using Google AI?” Gemini will scan the video’s visuals and audio for Google’s proprietary watermark
called SynthID . The response will be more than a yes or no, Google says. Gemini will point out
specific times when the watermark appears in the video or audio. The company rolled out this
capability for images in November, also limited to images made or edited with Google AI. Some
watermarks can be easily scrubbed , as OpenAI learned when it launched its Sora app full of
exclusively AI-generated videos. Google calls its own watermark “imperceptible.” Still, we don’t yet
know how easy it will be to remove, or how readily other platforms will detect the SynthID
information and tag the content as AI-generated. Google’s Nano Banano AI image generation model
within the Gemini embeds C2PA metadata , but the general lack of coordinated tagging of AI-generated
material across social media platforms allows deepfakes to go undetected. Gemini can handle videos
up to 100 MB and 90 seconds for verification. The feature is available in every language and

Strategy AI in Action Artificial Intelligence Creative Industries Deep Dives Features Inside AI
Marketing AI Retail & Logistics AI Zara is testing how far generative AI can be pushed into everyday
retail operations, starting with a part of the business that rarely gets attention in technology
discussions: product imagery. Recent reporting shows the retailer using AI to generate new images of
real models wearing different outfits, based on existing photoshoots. Models remain involved in the
process, including consent and compensation, but AI is used to extend and adapt imagery without
repeating production from scratch. The stated aim is to speed up content creation and reduce the
need for repeated shoots. On the surface, the change looks incremental. In practice, it reflects a
familiar pattern in enterprise AI adoption, where technology is introduced not to overhaul how a
business works, but to remove friction from tasks that repeat at scale. How Zara uses AI to reduce
friction in repeatable retail work For a global retailer like Zara, imagery is not a creative
afterthought. It is a production requirement tied directly to how quickly products can be launched,
refreshed, and sold across markets. Each item typically needs multiple visual variations for
different regions, digital channels, and campaign cycles. Even when garments change only slightly,
the surrounding production work often starts again from scratch. That repetition creates delays and
cost that are easy to overlook precisely because they are routine. AI offers a way to compress those
cycles by reusing approved material and generating variations without resetting the entire process.
AI enters the production pipeline The placement of the technology is as important as the capability
itself. Zara is not positioning AI as a separate creative product or asking teams to adopt an
entirely new workflow. The tools are being used inside an existing production pipeline, supporting
the same outputs with fewer handoffs. That keeps the focus on throughput and coordination rather
than experimentation. This kind of deployment is typical once AI moves beyond pilot stages. Rather
than asking organisations to rethink how work is done, the technology is introduced where
constraints already exist. The question becomes whether teams can move faster and with less
duplication, not whether AI can replace human judgement. The imagery initiative also sits alongside
a broader set of data-driven systems that Zara has built up over time. The retailer has long relied
on analytics and machine learning to forecast demand, allocate inventory, and respond quickly to
changes in customer behaviour. Those systems depend on fast feedback loops between what customers
see, what they buy, and how stock moves through the network. From that perspective, faster content
production supports the wider operation even if it is not framed as a strategic shift. When product
imagery can be updated or localised more quickly, it reduces lag between physical inventory, online
presentation, and customer response. Each improvement is small, but together they help maintain the
pace that fast fashion relies on. From experimentation to routine use Notably, the company has
avoided framing this move in grand terms. There are no published figures on cost savings or
productivity gains, and no claims that AI is transforming the creative function. The scope remains
narrow and operational, which limits both risk and expectation. That restraint is often a sign that
AI has moved out of experimentation and into routine use. Once technology becomes part of day-to-day
operations, organisations tend to talk about it less, not more. It stops being an innovation story
and starts being treated as infrastructure. There are also constraints that remain visible. The
process still relies on human models and creative oversight, and there is no suggestion that AI-
generated imagery operates independently. Quality control, brand consistency, and ethical
considerations continue to shape how the tools are applied. AI extends existing assets rather than
generating content in isolation. This is consistent with how enterprises typically approach creative
automation. Rather than replacing subjective work outright, they target the repeatable components
around it. Over time, those changes accumulate and reshape how teams allocate effort, even if the
core roles remain intact. Zara’s use of generative AI does not signal a reinvention of fashion
retail. It shows how AI is beginning to touch parts of the organisation that were previously
considered manual or difficult to standardise, without changing how the business fundamentally
operates. In large enterprises, that is often how AI adoption becomes durable. It does not arrive
through sweeping strategy announcements or dramatic claims. It takes hold through small, practical
changes that make everyday work move a little faster — until those changes become hard to imagine
doing without. (Photo by M. Rennim ) See also: Walmart’s AI strategy: Beyond the hype, what’s

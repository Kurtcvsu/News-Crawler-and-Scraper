Discovery , a biotech startup with backing from OpenAI, announced a $130 million Series B round at a
$1.3 billion valuation on Monday. The round was led by General Catalyst and Oak HC/FT, the company
said. Other participants include Menlo Ventures, OpenAI, Dimension, Thrive Capital, Neo, Yosemite
venture fund, Lachy Groom, SV Angel, and new investors Glade Brook and Emerson Collective. The
firm’s total funding now stands at over $225 million. The company is one in a growing industry that
sees AI as a faster route toward drug development. In August, Menlo Ventures announced it was
leading Chai’s $70 million Series A round. The investor described Chai as a startup that was
building foundation models tuned for drug discovery, specifically to predict interactions between
biochemical molecules so they could be reprogramed for cures. Chai says that its ambition is to
“build the ‘computer-aided design suite’ for molecules.” Last year, the startup announced the Chai 1
AI model and is now offering Chai 2, it’s latest model. The company says Chai 2 is achieving
significant improvements in success rates over other methods for de novo antibody design, meaning
building custom antibodies from scratch, not modifying existing ones. “Our latest models can design
molecules that have properties we’d want from actual drugs, and tackle challenging targets that have
been out of reach,” Josh Meier, Chai’s co-founder and CEO said in a prepared statement. Previously,
Meier, whose background is in machine learning, worked in research and engineering at Facebook and,
prior to that, worked for OpenAI, according to his LinkedIn . Chai Discovery was founded in 2024,

"Nvidia bulks up open source offerings with an acquisition and new open AI models"
Mon, 15 Dec 2025 22:00:57 +0000


Nvidia continues to expand its footprint in open source AI on two fronts: an acquisition and a new
model release. The semiconductor giant announced Monday it acquired SchedMD, the leading developer
of popular open source workload management system Slurm . Nvidia said the company will continue to
operate the program, which is designed for high-performance computing and AI, as an open source,
vendor-neutral software. Slurm was originally launched in 2002 and SchedMD was founded in 2010 by
the lead Slurm developers Morris Jette and Danny Auble. Auble is the current CEO of SchedMD. Terms
of the deal weren’t disclosed. Nvidia declined to comment on the news beyond the company’s blog post
. Nvidia has been working with SchedMD for more than a decade and said in its blog post the
technology is critical infrastructure for generative AI. The company plans to keep investing in the
technology and “accelerate” its access to different systems. The semiconductor company also released
a new family of open AI models on Monday. The company claimed this group of models, called Nvidia
Nemotron 3 , is the most “efficient family of open models” for building accurate AI agents. This
model family includes the Nemotron 3 Nano, a small model for targeted tasks, the Nemotron 3 Super, a
model built for multi-AI agent applications, and Nemotron 3 Ultra, built for more complicated tasks.

is the foundation of AI progress,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, wrote in the company’s
press release. “With Nemotron, we’re transforming advanced AI into an open platform that gives
developers the transparency and efficiency they need to build agentic systems at scale.” In recent
months, Nvidia has pushed to bolster its open source and open AI offerings. Last week, the company
announced a new open reasoning vision language model, Alpamayo-R1 , which is focused on autonomous
driving research. The company also said at the time it added more workflows and guides covering its
Cosmos world models, which are open source under a permissive license, to help developers better use
the models to develop physical AI. The activity is reflective of Nvidia’s bet that physical AI will
be the next frontier for its GPUs. Nvidia wants to be the go-to supplier for the many robotics — or
self-driving vehicle — companies looking for the AI and software to develop the brains behind the
technology. Topics AI , ai models , artificial intelligence , Enterprise , nvidia , open source ,

Categories: AI and Us AI in Action Deep Dives Features Finance AI World of Work JPMorgan Chase’s AI
strategy is delivering measurable returns – but at a human cost. The bank isn’t hiding the fact.
With 200,000 employees now using its proprietary LLM Suite platform daily and AI benefits growing
30-40% annually, America’s largest bank is executing what Chief Analytics Officer Derek Waldron
calls a plan to create the world’s first “ fully AI-connected enterprise .” What infrastructure
backs this transformation? A US$18 billion annual technology budget, 450+ AI use cases in
production, and a platform that won American Banker’s 2025 Innovation of the Year Grand Prize. But
JPMorgan’s candour about workforce displacement – operations staff projected to fall at least 10% –
reveals the complexity of enterprise AI beyond the promotional headlines. LLM suite: From zero to
200,000 users in eight months Released in summer 2024, LLM Suite reached 200,000 users in eight
months through an opt-in strategy that created what Waldron describes as “healthy competition,
driving viral adoption. This isn’t just a chatbot : LLM Suite functions as a “full ecosystem”
connecting AI to firm-wide data, applications, and workflows. The model-agnostic architecture
integrates OpenAI and Anthropic models, with updates every eight weeks. Investment bankers create
five-page decks in 30 seconds – work that previously took junior analysts hours. Lawyers scan and
generate contracts. Credit professionals extract covenant information instantly. Call centre tool
EVEE Intelligent Q&A improved resolution times through context-aware responses. “A little under half
of JPMorgan employees use gen AI tools every single day,” Waldron told McKinsey in October 2025.
“People use it in tens of thousands of ways specific to their jobs.” JPMorgan Chase AI strategy
delivers 30-40% annual ROI growth JPMorgan tracks ROI at the individual initiative level – not
platform-wide vanity metrics. Since inception, AI-attributed benefits have grown 30-40% year-over-
year. The strategy combines top-down focus on transformative domains (credit, fraud, marketing,
operations) with bottom-up democratisation, letting employees innovate in job families. McKinsey’s
Kevin Buehler estimates US$700 billion in potential banking cost savings industry-wide. But much
will be “competed away” to customers. Industry return on tangible equity could drop one to two
points, while AI pioneers could see four-point increases versus slow movers. Waldron acknowledges
productivity gains don’t automatically translate to cost reductions. “An hour saved here and three
hours there may increase individual productivity, but in end-to-end processes these snips often just
shift bottlenecks.” Operations staff to fall 10% as AI agents take complex tasks JPMorgan’s consumer
banking chief announced operations staff would decline at least 10% as the bank deploys “agentic AI”
– autonomous systems handling multi-step tasks. The bank is building AI agents that execute
cascading actions independently. Waldron demonstrated to CNBC how the system creates investment
banking presentations in 30 seconds and drafts confidential M&A memos. AI favours client-facing
roles – private bankers, traders, investment bankers. At risk: operations staff handling account
setup, fraud detection, and trade settlement. New job categories are emerging: “context engineers”
ensuring AI systems have proper information, knowledge management specialists, and up-skilled
software engineers building agentic systems. Stanford researchers analysing ADP data found early-
career workers (ages 22-25) in AI-exposed occupations saw 6% employment decline from late 2022 to
July 2025. Shadow IT, trust, and the “value gap” problem JPMorgan’s transparency extends to
acknowledging significant execution risks. Without enterprise-grade tools, employees might use
consumer-grade AI – exposing sensitive data. JPMorgan built an in-house system for security and
control. When AI performs correctly 85-95% of the time, human reviewers may stop checking carefully.
The error rate compounds at scale. “When an agentic system does a cascading series of analyses
independently for a long time, it raises questions about how humans can trust that,” Waldron told
McKinsey. Many enterprises face “proof-of-concept hell” – numerous pilots that never reach
production because they underestimate integration complexity. “There is a value gap between what the
technology is capable of and the ability to fully capture that in an enterprise,” Waldron told CNBC
. Even with US$18 billion, full realisation takes years. The JPMorgan playbook: What enterprises can
learn JPMorgan’s approach offers replicable principles despite scale advantages. Democratise access
but mandate nothing – the opt-in strategy created viral adoption. Build for security first,
particularly in regulated industries. Implement model-agnostic architecture to avoid vendor lock-in.
Combine top-down transformation with bottom-up innovation. Segment training by audience. Track ROI
with discipline at the initiative level. Acknowledge complexity and plan accordingly – JPMorgan took
over two years to build the LLM Suite. Not every enterprise has US$18 billion for technology or
200,000 employees. But core principles – democratisation, security-first architecture, avoiding
vendor lock-in, and financial discipline – apply in industries and scale. Transformation with eyes
wide open JPMorgan Chase’s AI strategy represents enterprise AI’s most transparent case study –
complete with industry-leading adoption metrics, measurable ROI growth, and unflinching
acknowledgement of workforce displacement. The bank’s success factors are clear: massive capital
investment, model-agnostic infrastructure, democratised access paired with financial discipline, and
realistic timelines. But Waldron’s candour about trust challenges, the “value gap” between
capability and execution, and the multi-year journey ahead suggest that even US$18 billion and
200,000 engaged employees don’t guarantee seamless transformation. For enterprises evaluating their
AI strategies, JPMorgan’s lesson isn’t that scale solves everything – it’s that honest assessment of
both opportunities and execution risks separates genuine transformation from expensive
experimentation. The question isn’t whether JPMorgan’s AI strategy is working. It’s whether the 10%
workforce reduction and years-long complexity represent acceptable trade-offs for 30-40% annual
benefit growth – and how many other enterprises can afford to find out. Editor’s note: The analysis
draws from McKinsey’s October 2025 interview with Derek Waldron and Kevin Buehler, CNBC’s September
2025 exclusive demonstration of LLM Suite, American Banker’s June 2025 Innovation of the Year
coverage, and Stanford University research on AI employment effects. See also: Walmart and Amazon

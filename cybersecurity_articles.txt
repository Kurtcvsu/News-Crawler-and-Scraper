"SoundCloud confirms breach after member data stolen, VPN access disrupted"
Mon, 15 Dec 2025 19:38:47 -0500


SoundCloud confirms breach after member data stolen, VPN access disrupted By Lawrence Abrams
December 15, 2025 07:38 PM 0 Audio streaming platform SoundCloud has confirmed that outages and VPN
connection issues over the past few days were caused by a security breach in which threat actors
stole a database exposing users' email addresses and profile information. The disclosure follows
widespread reports over the past four days from users who were unable to access SoundCloud when
connecting via VPN, with attempts resulting in the site displaying 403 "forbidden" errors. In a
statement shared with BleepingComputer, SoundCloud said it recently detected unauthorized activity
involving an ancillary service dashboard and activated its incident response procedures. SoundCloud
acknowledged that a threat actor accessed some of its data but said the exposure was limited in
scope. "We understand that a purported threat actor group accessed certain limited data that we
hold," SoundCloud told BleepingComputer. "We have completed an investigation into the data that was
impacted, and no sensitive data (such as financial or password data) has been accessed. The data
involved consisted only of email addresses and information already visible on public SoundCloud
profiles." BleepingComputer has learned that the breach affects 20% of SoundCloud’s users, which,
based on publicly reported user figures, could impact roughly 28 million accounts. The company said
it is confident that all unauthorized access to SoundCloud systems has been blocked and that there
is no ongoing risk to the platform. Working with third-party cybersecurity experts, the company said
it took additional steps to strengthen its security, including improving monitoring and threat
detection, reviewing identity and access controls, and conducting an assessment of related systems.
However, the company's response included a configuration change that disrupted VPN connectivity to
the site. SoundCloud has not provided a timeline for when VPN access will be fully restored.
Following the response, SoundCloud experienced denial-of-service attacks that temporarily disabled
the platform's web availability. After publishing our story, SoundCloud published a security notice
with this information. While SoundCloud has not shared details about the threat actor behind the
breach, BleepingComputer received a tip earlier today stating that the ShinyHunters extortion gang
was responsible. Our source said that ShinyHunters is now extorting SoundCloud after allegedly
stealing a database containing information about its users. ShinyHunters is also responsible for the
PornHub data breach that was first reported today by BleepingComputer. This is a developing story,
and we will update it as more information becomes available. Break down IAM silos like Bitpanda,

"Google is shutting down its dark web report feature in January"
Mon, 15 Dec 2025 18:24:57 -0500


Google is shutting down its dark web report feature in January By Mayank Parmar December 15, 2025
06:24 PM 0 Google is discontinuing its "dark web report" security tool, stating that it wants to
focus on other tools it believes are more helpful. Google's dark web report tool is a security
feature that notifies users if their email address or other personal information was found on the
dark web. After Google scans the dark web and identifies your personal information, it will notify
you where the data was found and what type of data was exposed, encouraging users to take action to
protect their data. Example of Google Dark Web Report tool Source: BleepingComputer For example, if
Google identifies your email on the dark web, you will be advised to turn on two-step authentication
to protect your Google account. Google sunsets the dark web report tool In an email seen by
BleepingComputer, Google confirmed it will stop monitoring for new dark web results on January 15,
2026, and its data will no longer be available from February 16, 2026. "We are discontinuing the
dark web report, which was meant to scan the dark web for your personal information," reads an email
seen by BleepingComputer. "It will stop monitoring for new results on January 15, 2026 and its data
will no longer be available from February 16, 2026. While the report offered general information,
feedback showed that it did not provide helpful next steps." "We're making this change to instead
focus on tools that give you more clear, actionable steps to protect your information online. We
will continue to track and defend you from online threats, including the dark web, and build tools
that help protect you and your personal information." Google Dark Web Report tool sunset
announcement Source: BleepingComputer Google will continue to invest in other tools, such as Google
Password Manager and the Password Checkup tool. "In the meantime, we encourage you to use the
existing tools we offer to strengthen your security and privacy, including Security and Privacy
Checkups, Passkey, 2-Step Verification, Google Password Manager, and Password Checkup," Google
explained in an email. Google says users can also use the " Results about you " tool to find and
request the removal of their personal information from Google Search results, like their phone
number and home address. However, some of you might miss Google's dark web report, which notified
users even when their address was found on the dark web. In addition, Google's dark web report
consolidated all potential dark web leaks in one place so that you could act quickly. Break down IAM

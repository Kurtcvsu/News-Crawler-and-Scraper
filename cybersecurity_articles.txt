"New critical WatchGuard Firebox firewall flaw exploited in attacks"
Fri, 19 Dec 2025 05:25:06 -0500


New critical WatchGuard Firebox firewall flaw exploited in attacks By Sergiu Gatlan December 19,
2025 05:25 AM 0 WatchGuard has warned customers to patch a critical, actively exploited remote code
execution (RCE) vulnerability in its Firebox firewalls. Tracked as CVE-2025-14733 , this security
flaw affects firewalls running Fireware OS 11.x and later (including 11.12.4_Update1), 12.x or later
(including 12.11.5), and 2025.1 up to and including 2025.1.3. The vulnerability is due to an out-of-
bounds write weakness that enables unauthenticated attackers to execute malicious code remotely on
unpatched devices, following successful exploitation in low-complexity attacks that don't require
user interaction. While unpatched Firebox firewalls are only vulnerable to attacks if configured to
use IKEv2 VPN, WatchGuard noted they might still be compromised, even if the vulnerable
configurations have been deleted, if a branch office VPN to a static gateway peer is still
configured. "If the Firebox was previously configured with the mobile user VPN with IKEv2 or a
branch office VPN using IKEv2 to a dynamic gateway peer, and both of those configurations have since
been deleted, that Firebox may still be vulnerable if a branch office VPN to a static gateway peer
is still configured," WatchGuard explained in a Thursday advisory. "WatchGuard has observed threat
actors actively attempting to exploit this vulnerability in the wild," the company warned. The
company also provided a temporary workaround for organizations that can't immediately patch devices
with vulnerable Branch Office VPN (BOVPN) configurations, requiring admins to disable dynamic peer
BOVPNs, add new firewall policies, and disable the default system policies that handle VPN traffic.

Firebox NV5, FireboxV WatchGuard shared indicators of compromise to help customers check whether
their Firebox devices have been compromised, and advised those who find any signs of malicious
activity to rotate all locally stored secrets on vulnerable appliances. In September, WatchGuard
patched another (almost identical) remote code execution vulnerability impacting its Firebox
firewalls (CVE-2025-9242). One month later, the Internet watchdog Shadowserver found over 75,000
Firebox firewalls vulnerable to CVE-2025-9242 attacks, most of them in North America and Europe.
After three weeks, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) tagged the
vulnerability as actively exploited in the wild and ordered federal agencies to secure their
WatchGuard Firebox firewalls from ongoing attacks. Two years ago, CISA ordered U.S. government
agencies to patch one more actively exploited WatchGuard flaw (CVE-2022-23176) impacting Firebox and
XTM firewall appliances . WatchGuard partners with more than 17,000 service providers and security
resellers to protect the networks of over 250,000 small and mid-sized companies worldwide. Break
